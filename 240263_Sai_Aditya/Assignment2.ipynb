From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country.\\nWe have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years or eight years, and we are just getting started. Thank you.\\nI return to this chamber tonight to report that America’s momentum is back, our spirit is back, our pride is back, our confidence is back, and the American dream is surging bigger and better than ever before. The American dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback, the likes of which the world has never witnessed and perhaps will never witness again. There’s never been anything like it.\\nThe presidential election of November 5th was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades. We won all seven swing states, giving us an electoral college victory of 312 votes. We won the popular vote —\\nREPRESENTATIVE GREEN: (Inaudible.)\\nTHE PRESIDENT: — by big numbers and won counties in our country —\\nAUDIENCE: Booo —\\nAUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!\\nREPRESENTATIVE GREEN: You are — you have no right to cut Medicaid.\\nAUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!\\nTHE PRESIDENT: — and won counties in our country 2,700 to 525 on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican.\\nNow, for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction. In fact, it’s an astonishing record: 27-point swing, the most ever.\\nLikewise, small-business optimism saw its single largest one-month gain ever recorded.\\nSPEAKER JOHNSON: Mr. President —\\nTHE PRESIDENT: A 41-point jump.\\n(Speaker Johnson strikes the gavel.)\\nSPEAKER JOHNSON: Members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the House and to cease any further disruptions. That’s your warning.\\nREPRESENTATIVE GREEN: He has no mandate to cut Medicaid.\\nSPEAKER JOHNSON: Members are engaging in willful and continuing breach of decorum, and the chair is prepared to direct the sergeant at arms to restore order to the joint session.\\nMr. Green, take your seat. Take your seat, sir.\\nREPRESENTATIVE GREEN: He has no mandate to cut Medicaid.\\nSPEAKER JOHNSON: Take your seat.\\nFinding that members continue to engage in willful and concerted disruption of proper decorum, the chair now directs the sergeant at arms to restore order. Remove this gentleman from the chamber.\\nREPRESENTATIVE GREEN: Shame on all of you.\\n(Members of the audience sing “Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye.”)\\n(Cross-talk.)\\nREPRESENTATIVE GREEN: You have no mandate.\\nSPEAKER JOHNSON: Members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the House.\\nMr. President, you can continue.\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you.\\nOver the past six weeks, I have signed nearly 100 executive orders and taken more than 400 executive actions — a record — to restore common sense, safety, optimism, and wealth all across our wonderful land. The people elected me to do the job, and I’m doing it.\\nIn fact, it has been stated by many that the first month of our presidency — it’s our presidency — is the most successful in the history of our nation by many. And what makes it even more impressive is that — do you know who number two is? George Washington. How about that? How about that? I don’t know about that list, but we’ll take it.\\nWithin hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the invasion of our country. And what a job they’ve done.\\nAs a result, illegal border crossings last month were, by far, the lowest ever recorded. Ever. They heard my words, and they chose not to come. Much easier that way.\\nIn comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history — there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members, and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country. Who would want to do that?\\nThis is my fifth such speech to Congress, and, once again, I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud. Nothing I can do. I could find a cure to the most devastating disease — a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded, and these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand, and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won’t do it no matter what.\\nFive times I’ve been up here. It’s very sad, and it just shouldn’t be this way.\\nSo, Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America? For the good of our nation, let’s work together and let’s truly make America great again.\\nEvery day, my administration is fighting to deliver the change America needs, to bring a future that America deserves, and we’re doing it. This is a time for big dreams and bold action.\\nUpon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations, and a freeze on all foreign aid. I terminated the ridiculous Green New Scam. I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying. I withdrew from the corrupt World Health Organization. And I also withdrew from the anti-American U.N. Human Rights Council.\\nWe ended all of Biden’s environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe and totally unaffordable. And importantly, we ended the last administration’s insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our autoworkers and companies from economic destruction.\\nTo unshackle our economy, I have directed that for every 1 new regulation, 10 old regulations must be eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first term. And in that first term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations like no other president had done before.\\nWe ordered all federal workers to return to the office. They will either show up for work in person or be removed from their job.\\nAnd we have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent, like me. How did that work out? Not too good. Not too good.\\nAnd I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America. It’s back.\\nAnd two days ago, I signed an order making English the official language of the United States of America.  \\nI renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America.\\nAnd, likewise, I renamed — for a great president, William McKinley — Mount McKinley again. Beautiful Alaska. We love Alaska.\\nWe’ve ended the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and, indeed, the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer.\\nWe believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer, or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender. Very important. You should be hired based on merit. And the Supreme Court, in a brave and very powerful decision, has allowed us to do so.\\nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.\\nWe have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools. And I signed an order making it the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.\\nI also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women’s sports.\\nThree years ago, Payton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete — one of the best — preparing for a future in college sports.  But when her girls’ volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton’s face, causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side, and ending her athletic career. It was a shot like she’s never seen before. She’s never seen anything like it.\\nPayton is here tonight in the gallery. And, Payton, from now on, schools will kick the men off the girls’ team or they will lose all federal funding.\\nAnd if you really want to see numbers, just take a look at what happened in the woman’s boxing, weightlifting, track and field, swimming, or cycling, where a male recently finished a long-distance race five hours and 14 minutes ahead of a woman for a new record by five hours. Broke the record by five hours.\\nIt’s demeaning for women, and it’s very bad for our country. We’re not going to put up with it any longer.\\nWhat I have just described is only a small fraction of the commonsense revolution that is now, because of us, sweeping the entire world. Common sense has become a common theme, and we will never go back. Never. Never going to let that happen.\\nAmong my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families. As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans. They’ve never had anything like it.\\nWe suffered the worst inflation in 48 years but perhaps even in the history of our country. They’re not sure. As president, I’m fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again.\\nJoe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control. The egg price is out of control, and we’re working hard to get it back down.\\nSecretary, do a good job on that. You inherited a total mess from the previous administration. Do a good job.\\nA major focus of our fight to defeat inflation is rapidly reducing the cost of energy. The previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95 percent, slowed pipeline construction to a halt, and closed more than 100 power plants. We are opening up many of those power plants right now.\\nAnd, frankly, we have never seen anything like it. That’s why, on my first day in office, I declared a national energy emergency. As you’ve heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth and by far. And now I’ve fully authorized the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It’s called drill, baby, drill.\\nMy administration is also working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska — among the largest in the world — where Japan, South Korea, and other nations want to be our partner with investments of trillions of dollars each. There’s never been anything like that one. It will be truly spectacular. It’s all set to go. The permitting is gotten.\\nAnd later this week, I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.\\nTo further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, but we’ll be ending the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars. And to that end, I have created the brand-new Department of Government Efficiency – DOGE. Perhaps you’ve heard of it — perhaps — which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight.\\nThank you, Elon. He’s working very hard. He didn’t need this. He didn’t need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Everybody here, even this side, appreciates it, I believe. They just don’t want to admit that.\\nJust listen to some of the appalling waste we have already identified.\\n$22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens.\\n$45 million for diversity, equity, and inclusion scholarships in Burma.\\n$40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants. Nobody knows what that is.\\n$8 million to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of.\\n$60 million for Indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian empowerment in Central America. $60 million.\\n$8 million for making mice transgender. This is real.\\n$32 million for a left-wing propaganda operation in Moldova.\\n$10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique.\\n$20 million for the Arab “Sesame Street” in the Middle East. It’s a program. $20 million for a program.\\n$1.9 billion to recently created decarbonization of homes committee, headed up — and we know she’s involved — just at the last moment, the money was passed over — by a woman named Stacey Abrams. Have you ever heard of her?\\nA $3.5 million consulting contract for lavish fish monitoring.\\n$1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia.\\n$14 million for social cohesion in Mali.\\n$59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City.\\nHe’s a real estate developer. He’s done very well.\\n$250,000 to increase vegan local climate action innovation in Zambia.\\n$42 million for social and behavior change in Uganda.\\n$14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia.\\n$47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia. Asia is doing very well with learning. Don’t know what we’re doing. We should use it ourselves.\\nAnd $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education, the most ever paid. Nothing even like it.\\nUnder the Trump administration, all of these scams — and there are far worse, but I didn’t think it was appropriate to talk about them. They’re so bad. Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people, headed up by Elon. And we appreciate it. We’ve found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.\\nAnd we’ve taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things. Taken back a lot of that money. We got it just in time.\\nThis is just the beginning. The Government Accountability Office, a federal government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 billion in our nation, and we are working very hard to stop it. We’re going to.\\nWe’re also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors and that our seniors and people that we love rely on. Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old.\\nIt lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. I don’t know any of them. I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly.\\n3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129.\\n3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139.\\n3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149.\\nAnd money is being paid to many of them, and we’re searching right now.\\nIn fact, Pam, good luck. Good luck. You’re going to find it.\\nBut a lot of money is paid out to people because it just keeps getting paid and paid, and nobody does — and it really hurts Social Security and hurts our country.\\n1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159. And over 130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are age over 160 years old.\\nWe have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby.\\nIncluding, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229; one person between the age of 240 and 249; and one person is listed at 360 years of age.\\nMore than 100 years older than our country.\\nBut we’re going to find out where that money is going, and it’s not going to be pretty.\\nBy slashing all of the fraud, waste, and theft we can find, we will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors, and put more money in the pockets of American families.\\nAnd today, interest rates took a beautiful drop — big, beautiful drop. It’s about time.\\nAnd in the near future, I want to do what has not been done in 24 years: balance the federal budget. We’re going to balance it.\\nWith that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the gold card, which goes on sale very, very soon.\\nFor $5 million, we will allow the most successful, job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship. It’s like the green card but better and more sophisticated. And these people will have to pay tax in our country. They won’t have to pay tax from where they came. The money that they’ve made, you wouldn’t want to do that, but they have to pay tax, create jobs.\\nThey’ll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country, instead of having them being forced out. Number one at the top school, as an example, being forced out and not being allowed to stay and create tremendous numbers of jobs and great success for a company out there.\\nSo, while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers, and child predators who were allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people — the Democrats, the Biden administration — the open border, insane policies that you’ve allowed to destroy our country — we will now bring in brilliant, hardworking, job-creating people. They’re going to pay a lot of money, and we’re going to reduce our debt with that money.\\nAmericans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change. For nearly 100 years, the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits, and held back America’s potential in every possible way. The nation founded by pioneers and risk-takers now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt.\\nApprovals that should take 10 days to get instead take 10 years, 15 years, and even 20 years before you’re rejected. Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been showing up to work.\\nMy administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, and we will restore true democracy to America again. Any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately because we are draining the swamp. It’s very simple. And the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over.\\nAnd the next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody. They’re in there. They’re waiting for you to vote.\\nAnd I’m sure that the people on my right — I don’t mean the Republican right, but my right right here — I’m sure you’re going to vote for those tax cuts, because, otherwise, I don’t believe the people will ever vote you into office. So, I’m doing you a big favor by telling you that.\\nBut I know this group is going to be voting for the taxes.\\nThank you. It’s a very, very big part of our plan. We had tremendous success in our first term with it. A very big part of our plan. We’re seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board.\\nAnd to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation, I’m calling for no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors.\\n(Addressing Speaker Johnson.) Good luck.\\nAnd I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible but only if the car is made in America.\\nAnd, by the way, we’re going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody has ever seen. Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made. Never seen. That’s a combination of the election win and tariffs.\\nIt’s a beautiful word, isn’t it?\\nThat, along with our other policies, will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. It’s going to boom. Spoke to the majors today — all three — the top people, and they’re so excited. In fact, already, numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world.\\nAnd this has taken place since our great victory on November 5th, a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country.\\nIn addition, as part of our tax cuts, we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing. And just as we did before, we will provide 100 percent expensing. It will be retroactive to January 20th, 2025, and it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, giving us the most successful economy in the history of our country. First term — we had a great first term.\\nIf you don’t make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff and, in some cases, a rather large one. Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it’s our turn to start using them against those other countries.\\nOn average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico, and Canada — have you heard of them? — and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It’s very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100 percent. China’s average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea’s average tariff is four times higher. Think of that: four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea, but that’s what happens.\\nThis is happening by friend and foe. This system is not fair to the United States and never was. And so, on April 2nd — I wanted to make it April 1st, but I didn’t want to be accused of April Fool’s Day. Just one day, which cost us a lot of money. But we’re going to do it in April. I’m a very superstitious person. April 2nd, reciprocal tariffs kick in. And whatever they tariff us — other countries — we will tariff them. That’s reciprocal, back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.\\nIf they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market. There’s a lot of that too. They don’t even allow us in their market.\\nWe will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before. I did it with China, and I did it with others. And the Biden administration couldn’t do anything about it because it was so much money. They couldn’t do anything about it.\\nWe have been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer.\\nMuch has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people — destroying families. Nobody has ever seen anything like it.\\nThey are, in effect, receiving subsidies of hundreds of billions of dollars. We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico of hundreds of billions of dollars. And the United States will not be doing that any longer. We’re not going to do it any longer.\\nThanks to our America First policies we’re putting into place, we have had $1.7 trillion of new investment in America in just the past few weeks. The combination of the election and our economic policies — the people of SoftBank, one of the most brilliant anywhere in the world, announced a $200 billion investment. OpenAI and Oracle — Larry Ellison — announced $500 billion investment, which they wouldn’t have done if Kamala had won.\\nApple announced $500 billion investment. Tim Cook called me. He said, “I cannot spend it fast enough.” It’s going to be much higher than that, I believe. They’ll be building their plants here, instead of in China.\\nAnd just yesterday, Taiwan Semiconductor — the biggest in the world, most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount — 97 percent of the market, announced a $165 billion investment to build the most powerful chips on Earth right here in the USA.\\nAnd we’re not giving them any money. Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing. We give hundreds of billions of dollars, and it doesn’t mean a thing. They take our money, and they don’t spend it. All that meant to them — we’re giving them no money. All that was important to them was they didn’t want to pay the tariffs, so they came and they’re building. And many other companies are coming.\\nWe don’t have to give them money. We just want to protect our businesses and our people. And they will come because they won’t have to pay tariffs if they build in America. And so, it’s very amazing.\\nYou should get rid of the CHIP Act. And whatever is left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to.\\nOur new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer — I love the farmer — who will now be selling into our home market, the USA, because nobody is going to be able to compete with you. Because those goods that come in from other countries and companies, they’re really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. They’re uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting, and they come in and they pour in, and they hurt our American farmers.\\nThe tariffs will go on agricultural product coming into America. And our farmers, starting on April 2nd — it may be a little bit of an adjustment period. We had that before, when I made the deal with China. Fifty billion dollars of purchases, and I said, “Just bear with me,” and they did. They did. Probably have to bear with me again, and this will be even better.\\nThat was great. The problem with it was that Biden didn’t enforce it. He didn’t enforce it. Fifty billion dollars of purchases, and we were doing great, but Biden did not enforce it. And it hurt our farmers, but our farmers are going to have a field day right now.\\nSo, to our farmers, have a lot of fun. I love you too. I love you too. It’s all going to happen.\\nAnd I have also imposed a 25 percent tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber, and steel, because if we don’t have, as an example, steel and lots of other things, we don’t have a military and, frankly, we just won’t have a country very long.\\nHere today is a proud American steelworker, fantastic person from Decatur, Alabama. Jeff Denard has been working at the same steel plant for 27 years in a job that has allowed him to serve as the captain of his local volunteer fire department; raise seven children with his beautiful wife, Nicole; and over the years, provide a loving home for more than 40 foster children. So great, Jeff.\\nThank you, Jeff. Thank you, Jeff.\\nStories like Jeff’s remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs. They’re about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it’s happening, and it will happen rather quickly.\\nThere will be a little disturbance, but we’re okay with that. It won’t be much.\\nNo, you’re not. Oh.\\nAnd look — and look where Biden took us. Very low. The lowest we’ve ever been.\\nJeff, I want to thank you very much.\\nAnd I also want to recognize another person who has devoted herself to foster care community. She worked so hard on it. A very loving person. Our magnificent first lady of the United States.\\nMelania’s work has yielded incredible results, helping prepare our nation’s future leaders as they enter the workforce.\\nOur first lady is joined by two impressive young women — very impressive: Haley Ferguson, who benefited from the first lady’s Fostering the Future initiative and is poised to complete her education and become a teacher, and Elliston Berry, who became a victim of an illicit deepfake image produced by a peer. With Elliston’s help, the Senate just passed the Take It Down Act —\\nThis is so important. Thank you very much, John. John Thune, thank you. Stand up, John. Thank you, John. Thank you all very much. Thank you.\\nAnd thank you to John Thune and the Senate. A great job.\\n— to criminalize the publication of such images online. This terrible, terrible thing. And once it passes the House, I look forward to signing that bill into law. Thank you.\\nAnd I’m going to use that bill for myself too, if you don’t mind because nobody gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody.\\nThat’s great. Thank you very much to the Senate. Thank you.\\nBut if we truly care about protecting America’s children, no step is more crucial than securing America’s borders. Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States. Many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world. Because of Joe Biden’s insane and very dangerous open border policies, they are now strongly embedded in our country, but we are getting them out and getting them out fast.\\nAnd I want to thank Tom Homan. And, Kristi, I want to thank you. And Paul of Border Patrol, I want to thank you. What a job they’ve all done. Everybody. Border Patrol, ICE. Law enforcement, in general, is incredible. We have to take care of our law enforcement. We have to.\\nLast year, a brilliant 22-year-old nursing student named Laken Riley — the best in her class, admired by everybody — went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia. That morning, Laken was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized, and horrifically murdered. Laken was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden’s open southern border and then set loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration. It was indeed a failed administration.\\nHe had then been arrested and released in a Democrat-run sanctuary city — a disaster — before ending the life of this beautiful young angel.\\nWith us this evening are Laken’s beloved mother, Allyson, and her sister, Lauren.\\nLast year, I told Laken’s grieving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain. That’s why the very first bill I signed into law as your 47th president mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety. It’s a very strong, powerful act. It’s called the Laken Riley Act.\\nSo, Allyson and Lauren, America will never, ever forget our beautiful Laken Hope Riley.\\nThank you very much.\\nSince taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history, and we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded. Thank you.\\nThe media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation. “We must have legislation to secure the border.” But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president.\\nThank you.\\nJoe Biden didn’t just open our borders. He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals, and communities throughout the country. Entire towns, like Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody has ever seen before. Beautiful towns destroyed.\\nNow, just as I promised in my Inaugural Address, we are achieving the great liberation of America.\\nBut there still is much work to be done.\\nHere tonight is a woman I have gotten to know: Alexis Nungaray from Houston. Wonderful woman. Last June, Alexis’s 12-year-old daughter, her precious Jocelyn, walked to a nearby convenience store. She was kidnapped, tied up, assaulted for two hours under a bridge, and horrifically murdered. Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela, released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border.\\nThe death of this beautiful 12-year-old girl and the agony of her mother and family touched our entire nation greatly.\\nAlexis, I promised that we would always remember your daughter — your magnificent daughter. And earlier tonight, I signed an order keeping my word to you.\\nOne thing I have learned about Jocelyn is that she loved animals so much. She loved nature. Across Galveston Bay from where Jocelyn lived in Houston, you will find a magnificent national wildlife refuge. A pristine, peaceful, 34,000-acre sanctuary for all of God’s creatures on the edge of the Gulf of America.\\nAlexis, moments ago, I formally renamed that refuge in loving memory of your beautiful daughter, Jocelyn.\\nSo, Mr. Vice President, if you would, may I have the order?\\n(The president holds up the executive order.)\\nThank you very much.\\nAll three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken’s murders were members of the Venezuelan prison gang — the toughest gang, they say, in the world — known as Tren de Aragua. Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang, along with MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations. They are now officially in the same category as ISIS, and that’s not good for them.\\nCountless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the U.S. by the Biden administration, but now every last one will be rounded up and forcibly removed from our country, or, if they’re too dangerous, put in jails, standing trial in this country, because we don’t want them to come back ever.\\nWith us this evening is a warrior on the front lines of that battle, Border Patrol agent Roberto Ortiz. Great guy.\\nIn January, Roberto and another agent were patrolling by the Rio Grande, near an area known as Cartel Island — doesn’t sound too nice to me — when heavily armed gunmen started shooting at them. Roberto saw that his partner was totally exposed, in great danger, and he leapt into action, returning fire and providing crucial seconds for his fellow agent to seek safety, and just barely. I have some of the prints of that event, and it was not good.\\nAgent Ortiz, we salute you for your great courage and for your line of fire that you took and for the bravery that you showed. We honor you, and we will always honor you. Thank you, Roberto, very much. Thank you, Roberto.\\nAnd I actually got to know him on my many calls to the border. He’s a great, great gentleman.\\nThe territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture, and exercise total control — they have total control over a whole nation — posing a grave threat to our national security. The cartels are waging war in America, and it’s time for America to wage war on the cartels, which we are doing.\\nFive nights ago, Mexican authorities, because of our tariff policies being imposed on them — think of this — handed over to us 29 of the biggest cartel leaders in their country. That has never happened before. hey want to make us happy. First time ever.\\nBut we need Mexico and Canada to do much more than they’ve done, and they have to stop the fentanyl and drugs pouring into the USA. They’re going to stop it.\\nI have sent Congress a detailed funding request laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats to protect our homeland and complete the largest deportation operation in American history, larger even than current record holder, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate man but someone who believed very strongly in borders. Americans expect Congress to send me this funding without delay so I can sign it into law.\\nSo, Mr. Speaker, John Thune, both of you, I hope you’re going to be able to do that. Mr. Speaker, thank you. Mr. Leader, thank you. Thank you very much. And let’s get it to me. I’ll sign it so fast, you won’t even believe it.\\nAnd as we reclaim our sovereignty, we must also bring back law and order to our cities and towns. In recent years, our justice system has been turned upside down by radical-left lunatics. Many jurisdictions virtually ceased enforcing the law against dangerous repeat offenders while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents like me.\\nMy administration has acted swiftly and decisively to restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law, starting at the FBI and the DOJ.\\nPam, good luck. Kash, wherever you may be, good luck. Good luck. Pam Bondi, good luck. So important. Going to do a great job.\\nKash, thank you. Thank you, Kash.\\nThey have already started very strong. They’re going to do a fantastic job. You’re going to be very proud of them.\\nWe’re also, once again, giving our police officers the support, protection, and respect they so dearly deserve. They have to get it. They have such a hard, dangerous job, but we’re going to make it less dangerous. The problem is the bad guys don’t respect the law, but they’re starting to respect it, and they soon will respect it.\\nThis also includes our great fire departments throughout the country. Our firemen and women are unbelievable people, and I will never forget them. And besides that, they voted for me in record numbers, so I have no choice.\\nOne year ago this month, 31-year-old New York police officer Jonathan Diller — unbelievably wonderful person and a great officer — was gunned down at a traffic stop on Long Island. I went to his funeral. The vicious criminal charged with his murder had 21 prior arrests, and they were rough arrests too. He was a real bad one.\\nThe thug in the seat next to him had 14 prior arrests and went by the name of “Killer.” He was Killer. He killed other people. They say a lot of them.\\nI attended Officer Diller’s service, and when I met his wife and one-year-old son, Ryan, it was very inspirational, actually. His widow’s name is Stephanie, and she is here tonight. Stephanie, thank you very much, Stephanie. Thank you very much.\\nStephanie, we’re going to make sure that Ryan knows his dad was a true hero — New York’s Finest. And we’re going to get these cold-blooded killers and repeat offenders off our streets, and we’re going to do it fast. Got to stop it.\\nThey get out with 28 arrests. They push people into subway trains. They hit people over the back of the head with baseball bats. We got to get them out of here.\\nI’ve already signed an executive order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer. And, tonight, I’m asking Congress to pass that policy into permanent law.\\nI’m also asking for a new crime bill, getting tough on repeat offenders while enhancing protections for America’s police officers so they can do their jobs without fear of their lives being totally destroyed. They don’t want to be killed. We’re not going to let them be killed.\\nJoining us in the gallery tonight is a young man who truly loves our police. His name is D.J. Daniel. He is 13 years old, and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer.\\nBut in 2018, D.J. was diagnosed with brain cancer. The doctors gave him five months at most to live. That was more than six years ago.\\nSince that time, D.J. and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true, and D.J. has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer, actually, a number of times. The police love him. The police departments love him.\\nAnd tonight, D.J., we’re going to do you the biggest honor of them all. I am asking our new Secret Service director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent of the United States Secret Service.\\n(Director Curran presents Mr. Daniel with a Secret Service Agent credential.)\\nAUDIENCE: D.J.! D.J.! D.J.!\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you, D.J.\\nD.J.’s doctors believe his cancer likely came from a chemical he was exposed to when he was younger. Since 1975, rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40 percent. Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new presidential commission to make America healthy again, chaired by our new secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\\nWith the name “Kennedy,” you would have thought everybody over here would have been cheering. How quickly they forget.\\nOur goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong.\\nAs an example, not long ago — you can’t even believe these numbers — 1 in 10,000 children had autism. 1 in 10,000. And now it’s 1 in 36. There’s something wrong. One in 36. Think of that.\\nSo, we’re going to find out what it is, and there’s nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you — you have the best — to figure out what is going on.\\nOkay, Bobby? Good luck. It’s a very important job. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\\nMy administration is also working to protect our children from toxic ideologies in our schools.\\nA few years ago, January Littlejohn and her husband discovered that their daughter’s school had secretly socially transitioned their 13-year-old little girl. Teachers and administrators conspired to deceive January and her husband, while encouraging her daughter to use a new name and pronouns — “they/them” pronouns, actually — all without telling January, who is here tonight and is now a courageous advocate against this form of child abuse. January, thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.\\nStories like this are why, shortly after taking office, I signed an executive order banning public schools from indoctrinating our children with transgender ideology.\\nI also signed an order to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the sexual mutilation of our youth. And now I want Congress to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body. This is a big lie.\\nAnd our message to every child in America is that you are perfect exactly the way God made you.\\nBecause we’re getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military, and it’s already out, and it’s out of our society. We don’t want it. Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It’s gone. It’s gone. And we feel so much better for it, don’t we? Don’t we feel better?\\nOur service members won’t be activists and ideologues. They will be fighters and warriors. They will fight for our country.\\nAnd, Pete, congratulations. Secretary of Defense, congratulations.\\nAnd he’s not big into the woke movement, I can tell you. I know him well.\\nI am pleased to report that, in January, the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years and that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in the history of our services. What a difference.\\nAnd you know it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. We couldn’t recruit anywhere. We couldn’t recruit. Now we’re having the best results, just about, that we’ve ever had. What a tremendous turnaround. It’s really a beautiful thing to see. People love our country again. It’s very simple. They love our country, and they love being in our military again. So, it’s a great thing. And thank you very much. Great job. Thank you.\\nWe’re joined tonight by a young man, Jason Hartley, who knows the weight of that call of duty. Jason’s father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all wore the uniform.\\nJason tragically lost his dad, who was also a Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy, when he was just a boy, and now he wants to carry on the family legacy of service. Jason is a senior in high school, a six-letter varsity athlete — a really good athlete, they say — a brilliant student, with a 4.46 — And his greatest dream is to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.\\nAnd, Jason, that’s a very big deal getting in. That’s a hard one to get into. But I’m pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted. You will soon be joining the Corps of Cadets.\\nThank you. Jason, you’re going to be on the Long Gray Line, Jason.\\nAs commander in chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future. As a first step, I’m asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome missile defense shield to protect our homeland, all made in the USA.\\nAnd Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology just wasn’t there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It’s incredible, actually. And other places, they have it: Israel has it. Other places have it. And the United States should have it too. Right, Tim? Right? They should have it too. So, I want to thank you.\\nBut it’s a very important. This is a very dangerous world. We should have it. We want to be protected. And we’re going to protect our citizens like never before.\\nTo boost our defense industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding.\\nAnd for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new Office of Shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America, where it belongs.\\nWe used to make so many ships. We don’t make them anymore very much, but we’re going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact.\\nTo further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it.\\nJust today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.\\nThe Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others, but others could use it. But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. Thirty-eight thousand workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snake bites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work. They paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25 percent chance that they would die. The most expensive project, also, that was ever built in our country’s history, if you bring it up to modern-day costs.\\nIt was given away by the Carter administration for $1, but that agreement has been violated very severely. We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.\\nAnd we have Marco Rubio in charge. Good luck, Marco. Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong.\\nNo, Marco has been amazing, and he’s going to do a great job. Think of it. He got a hundred votes. You know, he was approved with, actually, 99, but the 100th was this gentleman, and I feel very certain — so, let’s assume he got 100 votes. And I’m either very, very happy about that or I’m very concerned about it.\\nBut he’s already proven — I mean, he’s a great gentleman. He’s respected by everybody. And we appreciate you voting for Marco. He’s going to do a fantastic job. hank you. Thank you. He’s doing a great job. Great job.\\nAnd I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland. We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and, if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.\\nWe need Greenland for national security and even international security, and we’re working with everybody involved to try and get it. But we need it, really, for international world security. And I think we’re going to get it. One way or the other, we’re going to get it.\\nWe will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before.\\nIt’s a very small population but very, very large piece of land and very, very important for military security.\\nAmerica is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism.\\nThree and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan — not that they were withdrawing; it was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.\\nTonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.\\nAnd I want to thank, especially, the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster.\\nThis was a very momentous day for those 13 families, who I actually got to know very well, most of them, whose children were murdered, and the many people that were so badly — over 42 people — so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan. What a horrible day. Such incompetence was shown that when Putin saw what happened, I guess he said, “Wow, maybe this is my chance.” That’s how bad it was. Should have never happened. Grossly incompetent people.\\nI spoke to many of the parents and loved ones, and they’re all in our hearts tonight. Just spoke to them on the phone. We had a big call. Every one of them called, and everybody was on the line, and they did nothing but cry with happiness. They were very happy — as happy as you can be under those circumstances. heir child, brother, sister, son, daughter was killed for no reason whatsoever.\\nIn the Middle East, we’re bringing back our hostages from Gaza. In my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations: the Abraham Accords.\\nAnd now we’re going to build on that foundation to create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region. A lot of things are happening in the Middle East. People haven’t been talking about that so much lately with everything going on with Ukraine and Russia, but a lot of things are happening in the Middle East. It’s a rough neighborhood, actually.\\nI’m also working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine. Millions of Ukrainians and Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict with no end in sight.\\nThe United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine’s defense with no security, with no anything.\\nDo you want to keep it going for another five years?\\nSENATOR WARREN: Yes!\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Yeah, you would say — Pocahontas says, “Yes.”\\nTwo thousand people are being killed every single week — more than that. They’re Russian young people. They’re Ukrainian young people. They’re not Americans. But I want it to stop.\\nMeanwhile, Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine, by far. Think of that. They’ve spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending. And we’ve spent, perhaps, $350 billion. Like taking candy from a baby, that’s what happened. And they’ve spent $100 billion. What a difference that is. And we have an ocean separating us, and they don’t.\\nBut we’re getting along very well with them, and lots of good things are happening.\\nBiden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent by billions and billions of dollars. It’s hard to believe that they wouldn’t have stopped it and said, at some point, “Come on. Let’s equalize. You got to be equal to us.” But that didn’t happen.\\nEarlier today, I received an important letter from President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. The letter reads, “Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer.” “Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,” he said. “My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you.”\\nI appreciate that he sent this letter. Just got it a little while ago.\\nSimultaneously, we’ve had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace. Wouldn’t that be beautiful? Wouldn’t that be beautiful? Wouldn’t that be beautiful?\\nIt’s time to stop this madness. t’s time to halt the killing. It’s time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides.\\nNearly four years ago, amid rising tensions, a history teacher named Marc Fogel was detained in Russia and sentenced to 14 years in a penal colony. Rough stuff.\\nThe previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him. They knew he was innocent, but they had no idea where to begin. But last summer, I promised his 95-year-old mother, Malphine, that we would bring her boy safely back home.\\nAfter 22 days in office, I did just that, and they are here tonight.\\nTo Marc and his great mom, we are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us.\\nAs fate would have it, Marc Fogel was born in a small, rural town — in Butler, Pennsylvania — have you heard of it? — where his mother has lived for the past 78 years.\\nI just happened to go there last July 13th for a rally. That was not pleasant. And that is where I met his beautiful mom, right before I walked onto that stage. And I told her I would not forget what she said about her son. And I never did, did I? Never forgot.\\nLess than 10 minutes later, at that same rally, gunfire rang out, and a sick and deranged assassin unloaded eight bullets from his sniper’s perch into a crowd of many thousands of people.\\nMy life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky. Corey Comperatore was a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, and, above all, a protector.\\nWhen the sound of gunshots pierced the air — it was a horrible sound — Corey knew instantly what it was and what to do. He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters and shielded them from the bullets with his own body.\\nCorey was hit really hard. You know the story from there. He sacrificed his life to save theirs.\\nTwo others — very fine people — were also seriously hit. But thankfully, with the help of two great country doctors, we thought they were gone, and they were saved. So, those doctors had great talent.\\nWe’re joined by Corey’s wife, Helen, who was his high school sweetheart, and their two beloved daughters, Allyson and Kaylee. Thank you.\\nTo Helen, Allyson, and Kaylee, Corey is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now, and he is cheering you on. He loves you. He is cheering you on.\\nCorey was taken from us much too soon, but his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selfless devotion of a true American patriot. It was love like Corey’s that built our country, and it’s love like Corey’s that is going to make our country more majestic than ever before.\\nI believe that my life was saved that day in Butler for a very good reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. ;I believe that. Thank you.\\nThank you. Thank you very much.\\nFrom the patriots of Lexington and Concord to the heroes of Gettysburg and Normandy, from the warriors who crossed the Delaware to the trailblazers who climbed the Rockies, and from the legends who soared at Kitty Hawk to the astronauts who touched the Moon, Americans have always been the people who defied all odds, transcended all dangers, made the most extraordinary sacrifices, and did whatever it took to defend our children, our country, and our freedom.\\nAnd as we have seen in this chamber tonight, that same strength, faith, love, and spirit is still alive and thriving in the hearts of the American people. Despite the best efforts of those who would try to censor us, silence us, break us, destroy us, Americans are today a proud, free, sovereign, and independent nation that will always be free, and we will fight for it till death.\\nWe will never let anything happen to our beloved country, because we are a country of doers, dreamers, fighters, and survivors.\\nOur ancestors crossed a vast ocean, strode into the unknown wilderness, and carved their fortunes from the rock and soil of a perilous and very dangerous frontier. They chased our destiny across a boundless continent. They built the railroads, laid the highways, and graced the world with American marvels, like the Empire State Building, the mighty Hoover Dam, and the towering Golden Gate Bridge.\\nThey lit the world with electricity, broke free of the force of gravity, fired up the engines of American industry, vanquished the communists, fascists, and Marxists all over the world, and gave us countless modern wonders sculpted out of iron, glass, and steel.\\nWe stand on the shoulders of these pioneers who won and built the modern age, these workers who poured their sweat into the skylines of our cities, these warriors who shed their blood on fields of battle and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.\\nNow it is our time to take up the righteous cause of American liberty, and it is our turn to take America’s destiny into our own hands and begin the most thrilling days in the history of our country.\\nThis will be our greatest era.\\nWith God’s help, over the next four years, we are going to lead this nation even higher, and we are going to forge the freest, most advanced, most dynamic, and most dominant civilization ever to exist on the face of this Earth.\\nWe are going to create the highest quality of life, build the safest and wealthiest and healthiest and most vital communities anywhere in the world.\\nWe are going to conquer the vast frontiers of science, and we are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars and even far beyond.\\nAnd, through it all, we are going to rediscover the unstoppable power of the American spirit, and we are going to renew unlimited promise of the American dream.\\nEvery single day, we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country our citizens believe in and for the country our people deserve. Thank you. Thank you.\\nMy fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future, because the golden age of America has only just begun. t will be like nothing that has ever been seen before.\\nThank you. God bless you. And God bless America.\\n=====================================================================\\n\\n\\nJanuary 20, 2025: Inaugural Address\\nTranscript\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Wow. Thank you very, very much.\\nVice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and my fellow citizens, the golden age of America begins right now.\\nFrom this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer. During every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first.\\nOur sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end.\\nAnd our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous, and free.\\nAmerica will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before.\\nI return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country, sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.\\nBut first, we must be honest about the challenges we face. While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing in the United States of America.\\nAs we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust. For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.\\nWe now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while, at the same time, stumbling into a continuing catalogue of catastrophic events abroad.\\nIt fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions, that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.\\nWe have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders but refuses to defend American borders or, more importantly, its own people.\\nOur country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina—who have been treated so badly—and other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago or, more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense. They’re raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country—some of whom are sitting here right now. They don’t have a home any longer. That’s interesting. But we can’t let this happen. Everyone is unable to do anything about it. That’s going to change.\\nWe have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world.\\nAnd we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves—in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.\\nMy recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and, indeed, their freedom. From this moment on, America’s decline is over.\\nOur liberties and our nation’s glorious destiny will no longer be denied. And we will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of America’s government.\\nOver the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history, and I’ve learned a lot along the way.\\nThe journey to reclaim our republic has not been an easy one—that, I can tell you. Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and, indeed, to take my life.\\nJust a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin’s bullet ripped through my ear. But I felt then and believe even more so now that my life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God to make America great again.\\nThank you. Thank you.\\nThank you very much.\\nThat is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength. We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety, and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.\\nFor American citizens, January 20th, 2025, is Liberation Day. It is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country.\\nAs our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society: young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural. And very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states and the popular vote, we won by millions of people.\\nTo the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records, and I will not forget it. I’ve heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.\\nToday is Martin Luther King Day. And his honor—this will be a great honor. But in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality. We will make his dream come true.\\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you.\\nNational unity is now returning to America, and confidence and pride is soaring like never before. In everything we do, my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success. We will not forget our country, we will not forget our Constitution, and we will not forget our God. Can’t do that.\\nToday, I will sign a series of historic executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It’s all about common sense.\\nFirst, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border.\\nAll illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my Remain in Mexico policy.\\nI will end the practice of catch and release.\\nAnd I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country.\\nUnder the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.\\nAnd by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil, including our cities and inner cities.\\nAs commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do. We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.\\nNext, I will direct all members of my cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices.\\nThe inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices, and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.\\nAmerica will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have—the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth—and we are going to use it. We’ll use it.\\nWe will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top, and export American energy all over the world.\\nWe will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.\\nWith my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal, and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers.\\nIn other words, you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice.\\nWe will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago. And thank you to the autoworkers of our nation for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did tremendously with their vote.\\nI will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.\\nFor this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues. It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our Treasury, coming from foreign sources.\\nThe American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before.\\nTo restore competence and effectiveness to our federal government, my administration will establish the brand-new Department of Government Efficiency.\\nAfter years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I also will sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America.\\nNever again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents—something I know something about. We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again.\\nUnder my leadership, we will restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law.\\nAnd we are going to bring law and order back to our cities.\\nThis week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life. We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based.\\nAs of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.\\nThis week, I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from our military for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full back pay.\\nAnd I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty. It’s going to end immediately. Our armed forces will be freed to focus on their sole mission: defeating America’s enemies.\\nLike in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end—and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.\\nMy proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That’s what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier.\\nI’m pleased to say that as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families.\\nThank you.\\nAmerica will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world.\\nA short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, and we will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs.\\nPresident McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent—he was a natural businessman—and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United Spates—the United States, I mean, think of this—spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal.\\nWe have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made, and Panama’s promise to us has been broken.\\nThe purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape, or form. And that includes the United States Navy.\\nAnd above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.\\nAbove all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor, and the vitality of history’s greatest civilization.\\nSo, as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success. We will not be deterred. Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy, and disease-free.\\nThe United States will once again consider itself a growing nation—one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons.\\nAnd we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.\\nAmbition is the lifeblood of a great nation, and, right now, our nation is more ambitious than any other. There’s no nation like our nation.\\nAmericans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs, and pioneers. The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls.\\nOur American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth. No one comes close.\\nAmericans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness. They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens, and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand. If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve.\\nMany people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback. But as you see today, here I am. The American people have spoken.\\nI stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do. In America, the impossible is what we do best.\\nFrom New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, DC, our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.\\nThey were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steelworkers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward, and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride.\\nTogether, they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced.\\nAfter all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history. With your help, we will restore America promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love—and we love it so much.\\nWe are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. So, to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future, I am with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you. We’re going to win like never before.\\nThank you. Thank you.\\nThank you. Thank you.\\nIn recent years, our nation has suffered greatly. But we are going to bring it back and make it great again, greater than ever before.\\nWe will be a nation like no other, full of compassion, courage, and exceptionalism. Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable.\\nAmerica will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith, and goodwill. We will be prosperous, we will be proud, we will be strong, and we will win like never before.\\nWe will not be conquered, we will not be intimidated, we will not be broken, and we will not fail. From this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign, and independent nation.\\nWe will stand bravely, we will live proudly, we will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans. The future is ours, and our golden age has just begun.\\nThank you. God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\n=====================================================================\\n\\n\\nJanuary 19, 2021: Farewell Address\\nMy fellow Americans: Four years ago, we launched a great national effort to rebuild our country, to renew its spirit, and to restore the allegiance of this government to its citizens. In short, we embarked on a mission to make America great again — for all Americans.\\nAs I conclude my term as the 45th President of the United States, I stand before you truly proud of what we have achieved together. We did what we came here to do — and so much more.\\nThis week, we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous. We extend our best wishes, and we also want them to have luck — a very important word.\\nI’d like to begin by thanking just a few of the amazing people who made our remarkable journey possible.\\nFirst, let me express my overwhelming gratitude for the love and support of our spectacular First Lady, Melania. Let me also share my deepest appreciation to my daughter Ivanka, my son-in-law Jared, and to Barron, Don, Eric, Tiffany, and Lara. You fill my world with light and with joy.\\nI also want to thank Vice President Mike Pence, his wonderful wife Karen, and the entire Pence family.\\nThank you as well to my Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows; the dedicated members of the White House Staff and the Cabinet; and all the incredible people across our administration who poured out their heart and soul to fight for America.\\nI also want to take a moment to thank a truly exceptional group of people: the United States Secret Service. My family and I will forever be in your debt. My profound gratitude as well to everyone in the White House Military Office, the teams of Marine One and Air Force One, every member of the Armed Forces, and state and local law enforcement all across our country.\\nMost of all, I want to thank the American people. To serve as your President has been an honor beyond description. Thank you for this extraordinary privilege. And that’s what it is — a great privilege and a great honor.\\nWe must never forget that while Americans will always have our disagreements, we are a nation of incredible, decent, faithful, and peace-loving citizens who all want our country to thrive and flourish and be very, very successful and good. We are a truly magnificent nation.\\nAll Americans were horrified by the assault on our Capitol. Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans. It can never be tolerated.\\nNow more than ever, we must unify around our shared values and rise above the partisan rancor, and forge our common destiny.\\nFour years ago, I came to Washington as the only true outsider ever to win the presidency. I had not spent my career as a politician, but as a builder looking at open skylines and imagining infinite possibilities. I ran for President because I knew there were towering new summits for America just waiting to be scaled. I knew the potential for our nation was boundless as long as we put America first.\\nSo I left behind my former life and stepped into a very difficult arena, but an arena nevertheless, with all sorts of potential if properly done. America had given me so much, and I wanted to give something back.\\nTogether with millions of hardworking patriots across this land, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country. We also built the greatest economy in the history of the world. It was about “America First” because we all wanted to make America great again. We restored the principle that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Our agenda was not about right or left, it wasn’t about Republican or Democrat, but about the good of a nation, and that means the whole nation.\\nWith the support and prayers of the American people, we achieved more than anyone thought possible. Nobody thought we could even come close.\\nWe passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We slashed more job-killing regulations than any administration had ever done before. We fixed our broken trade deals, withdrew from the horrible Trans-Pacific Partnership and the impossible Paris Climate Accord, renegotiated the one-sided South Korea deal, and we replaced NAFTA with the groundbreaking USMCA — that’s Mexico and Canada — a deal that’s worked out very, very well.\\nAlso, and very importantly, we imposed historic and monumental tariffs on China; made a great new deal with China. But before the ink was even dry, we and the whole world got hit with the China virus. Our trade relationship was rapidly changing, billions and billions of dollars were pouring into the U.S., but the virus forced us to go in a different direction.\\nThe whole world suffered, but America outperformed other countries economically because of our incredible economy and the economy that we built. Without the foundations and footings, it wouldn’t have worked out this way. We wouldn’t have some of the best numbers we’ve ever had.\\nWe also unlocked our energy resources and became the world’s number-one producer of oil and natural gas by far. Powered by these policies, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We reignited America’s job creation and achieved record-low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women — almost everyone.\\nIncomes soared, wages boomed, the American Dream was restored, and millions were lifted from poverty in just a few short years. It was a miracle. The stock market set one record after another, with 148 stock market highs during this short period of time, and boosted the retirements and pensions of hardworking citizens all across our nation. 401(k)s are at a level they’ve never been at before. We’ve never seen numbers like we’ve seen, and that’s before the pandemic and after the pandemic.\\nWe rebuilt the American manufacturing base, opened up thousands of new factories, and brought back the beautiful phrase: “Made in the USA.”\\nTo make life better for working families, we doubled the child tax credit and signed the largest-ever expansion of funding for childcare and development. We joined with the private sector to secure commitments to train more than 16 million American workers for the jobs of tomorrow.\\nWhen our nation was hit with the terrible pandemic, we produced not one, but two vaccines with record-breaking speed, and more will quickly follow. They said it couldn’t be done but we did it. They call it a “medical miracle,” and that’s what they’re calling it right now: a “medical miracle.”\\nAnother administration would have taken 3, 4, 5, maybe even up to 10 years to develop a vaccine. We did in nine months.\\nWe grieve for every life lost, and we pledge in their memory to wipe out this horrible pandemic once and for all.\\nWhen the virus took its brutal toll on the world’s economy, we launched the fastest economic recovery our country has ever seen. We passed nearly $4 trillion in economic relief, saved or supported over 50 million jobs, and slashed the unemployment rate in half. These are numbers that our country has never seen before.\\nWe created choice and transparency in healthcare, stood up to big pharma in so many ways, but especially in our effort to get favored-nations clauses added, which will give us the lowest prescription drug prices anywhere in the world.\\nWe passed VA Choice, VA Accountability, Right to Try, and landmark criminal justice reform.\\nWe confirmed three new justices of the United States Supreme Court. We appointed nearly 300 federal judges to interpret our Constitution as written.\\nFor years, the American people pleaded with Washington to finally secure the nation’s borders. I am pleased to say we answered that plea and achieved the most secure border in U.S. history. We have given our brave border agents and heroic ICE officers the tools they need to do their jobs better than they have ever done before, and to enforce our laws and keep America safe.\\nWe proudly leave the next administration with the strongest and most robust border security measures ever put into place. This includes historic agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, along with more than 450 miles of powerful new wall.\\nWe restored American strength at home and American leadership abroad. The world respects us again. Please don’t lose that respect.\\nWe reclaimed our sovereignty by standing up for America at the United Nations and withdrawing from the one-sided global deals that never served our interests. And NATO countries are now paying hundreds of billions of dollars more than when I arrived just a few years ago. It was very unfair. We were paying the cost for the world. Now the world is helping us.\\nAnd perhaps most importantly of all, with nearly $3 trillion, we fully rebuilt the American military — all made in the USA. We launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in 75 years: the Space Force. And last spring, I stood at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and watched as American astronauts returned to space on American rockets for the first time in many, many years.\\nWe revitalized our alliances and rallied the nations of the world to stand up to China like never before.\\nWe obliterated the ISIS caliphate and ended the wretched life of its founder and leader, al Baghdadi. We stood up to the oppressive Iranian regime and killed the world’s top terrorist, Iranian butcher Qasem Soleimani.\\nWe recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.\\nAs a result of our bold diplomacy and principled realism, we achieved a series of historic peace deals in the Middle East. Nobody believed it could happen. The Abraham Accords opened the doors to a future of peace and harmony, not violence and bloodshed. It is the dawn of a new Middle East, and we are bringing our soldiers home.\\nI am especially proud to be the first President in decades who has started no new wars.\\nAbove all, we have reasserted the sacred idea that, in America, the government answers to the people. Our guiding light, our North Star, our unwavering conviction has been that we are here to serve the noble everyday citizens of America. Our allegiance is not to the special interests, corporations, or global entities; it’s to our children, our citizens, and to our nation itself.\\nAs President, my top priority, my constant concern, has always been the best interests of American workers and American families. I did not seek the easiest course; by far, it was actually the most difficult. I did not seek the path that would get the least criticism. I took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices because that’s what you elected me to do. Your needs were my first and last unyielding focus.\\nThis, I hope, will be our greatest legacy: Together, we put the American people back in charge of our country. We restored self-government. We restored the idea that in America no one is forgotten, because everyone matters and everyone has a voice. We fought for the principle that every citizen is entitled to equal dignity, equal treatment, and equal rights because we are all made equal by God. Everyone is entitled to be treated with respect, to have their voice heard, and to have their government listen. You are loyal to your country, and my administration was always loyal to you.\\nWe worked to build a country in which every citizen could find a great job and support their wonderful families. We fought for the communities where every American could be safe and schools where every child could learn. We promoted a culture where our laws would be upheld, our heroes honored, our history preserved, and law-abiding citizens are never taken for granted. Americans should take tremendous satisfaction in all that we have achieved together. It’s incredible.\\nNow, as I leave the White House, I have been reflecting on the dangers that threaten the priceless inheritance we all share. As the world’s most powerful nation, America faces constant threats and challenges from abroad. But the greatest danger we face is a loss of confidence in ourselves, a loss of confidence in our national greatness. A nation is only as strong as its spirit. We are only as dynamic as our pride. We are only as vibrant as the faith that beats in the hearts of our people.\\nNo nation can long thrive that loses faith in its own values, history, and heroes, for these are the very sources of our unity and our vitality.\\nWhat has always allowed America to prevail and triumph over the great challenges of the past has been an unyielding and unashamed conviction in the nobility of our country and its unique purpose in history. We must never lose this conviction. We must never forsake our belief in America.\\nThe key to national greatness lies in sustaining and instilling our shared national identity. That means focusing on what we have in common: the heritage that we all share.\\nAt the center of this heritage is also a robust belief in free expression, free speech, and open debate. Only if we forget who we are, and how we got here, could we ever allow political censorship and blacklisting to take place in America. It’s not even thinkable. Shutting down free and open debate violates our core values and most enduring traditions.\\nIn America, we don’t insist on absolute conformity or enforce rigid orthodoxies and punitive speech codes. We just don’t do that. America is not a timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree. That’s not who we are. It will never be who we are.\\nFor nearly 250 years, in the face of every challenge, Americans have always summoned our unmatched courage, confidence, and fierce independence. These are the miraculous traits that once led millions of everyday citizens to set out across a wild continent and carve out a new life in the great West. It was the same profound love of our God-given freedom that willed our soldiers into battle and our astronauts into space.\\nAs I think back on the past four years, one image rises in my mind above all others. Whenever I traveled all along the motorcade route, there were thousands and thousands of people. They came out with their families so that they could stand as we passed, and proudly wave our great American flag. It never failed to deeply move me. I knew that they did not just come out to show their support of me; they came out to show me their support and love for our country.\\nThis is a republic of proud citizens who are united by our common conviction that America is the greatest nation in all of history. We are, and must always be, a land of hope, of light, and of glory to all the world. This is the precious inheritance that we must safeguard at every single turn.\\nFor the past four years, I have worked to do just that. From a great hall of Muslim leaders in Riyadh to a great square of Polish people in Warsaw; from the floor of the Korean Assembly to the podium at the United Nations General Assembly; and from the Forbidden City in Beijing to the shadow of Mount Rushmore, I fought for you, I fought for your family, I fought for our country. Above all, I fought for America and all it stands for — and that is safe, strong, proud, and free.\\nNow, as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration at noon on Wednesday, I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning. There’s never been anything like it. The belief that a nation must serve its citizens will not dwindle but instead only grow stronger by the day.\\nAs long as the American people hold in their hearts deep and devoted love of country, then there is nothing that this nation cannot achieve. Our communities will flourish. Our people will be prosperous. Our traditions will be cherished. Our faith will be strong. And our future will be brighter than ever before.\\nI go from this majestic place with a loyal and joyful heart, an optimistic spirit, and a supreme confidence that for our country and for our children, the best is yet to come.\\nThank you, and farewell. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\\n======================================================================\\n\\n\\nFebruary 15, 2019: Speech Declaring a National Emergency\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody.  Before we begin, I’d like to just say that we have a large team of very talented people in China.  We’ve had a negotiation going on for about two days.  It’s going extremely well.  Who knows what that means, because it only matters if we get it done.  But we’re very much working very closely with China and President Xi, who I respect a lot.  Very good relationship that we have.  And we’re a lot closer than we ever were in this country with having a real trade deal.\\nWe’re covering everything — all of the points that people have been talking about for years that said couldn’t be done, whether it was theft or anything.  Anything.  The unfairness.  We’ve been losing, on average, $375 billion a year with China.  A lot of people think it’s $506 billion.  Some people think it’s much more than that.  We’re going to be leveling the playing field.\\nThe tariffs are hurting China very badly.  They don’t want them.  And frankly, if we can make the deal, it’d be my honor to remove them.  But otherwise, we’re having many billions of dollars pouring into our Treasury.  We’ve never had that before with China.  It’s been very much of a one-way street.\\nSo, that’s happening.  And the relationship with China is very good, but I think they finally respect our country.  They haven’t respected us for a long time.  Not for a long time.\\nThe UK and the U.S., as you probably have been seeing and hearing, we’re agreeing to go forward and preserve our trade agreement.  You know all of the situation with respect to Brexit, and the complexity and the problems.  But we have a very good trading relationship with the UK, and that’s just been strengthened further.\\nSo with the UK, we’re continuing our trade, and we are going to actually be increasing it very substantially as time goes by.  We expect that the UK will be very, very substantially increased as it relates to trade with the United States.  The relationship there, also, is very good.\\nWe have a lot of great announcements having to do with Syria and our success with the eradication of the caliphate.  And that will be announced over the next 24 hours.  And many other things.  A lot of positive things are going on.\\nWe’re working on a summit.  And you know all about the summit.  It will be in Vietnam — Hanoi.  And we will — we’ll be meeting in Hanoi.  We’ll be meeting in Hanoi.  I think a lot of you will be going, I suspect.  And I hope we have the same good luck as we had in the first summit.  A lot was done in the first summit.  No more rockets going up.  No more missiles going up.  No more testing of nuclear.  Get back our remains, the remains of our great heroes from the Korean War.  And we got back our hostages.\\nBut we hope we’re going to be very much equally as successful.  I’m in no rush for speed.  We just don’t want testing.  The sanctions, as you know, remain.  Everything is remaining.  China has been helping us, and Russia has been helping us.  And South Korea, I think you can say, has been — we’ve been working very closely with South Korea, with Japan.\\nBut China, Russia, on the border, have really been at least partially living up to what they’re supposed to be doing.  And that’s okay — as per the United Nations.\\nSo we will have a meeting on the 27th and 28th of February, and I think that will be a very successful one.  I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim.  We have also established a very good relationship, which has never happened between him or his family and the United States.  They have really taken advantage of the United States.  Billions of dollars has been paid to them.  And we won’t let that happen.\\nBut we think that North Korea and Chairman Kim have a tremendous potential as an economic force, economic power.  Their location between South Korea and then Russia and China — right smack in the middle — is phenomenal.\\nAnd we think that they have a great chance for tremendous economic prosperity in the future.  So I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim in Vietnam.\\nToday, I’m announcing several critical actions that my administration has taken to confront a problem that we have right here at home.  We fight wars that are 6,000 miles away; wars that we should have never been in, in many cases.  But we don’t control our own border.\\nSo we’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border.  And we’re going to do it one way or the other — we have to do it — not because it was a campaign promise, which it is.  It was one of many, by the way; not my only one.  We’re rebuilding the military, our economy is thriving like never before.\\nYou look at other economies — they’re doing terribly, and we’re doing phenomenally.  The market is up tremendously today, not that that’s anything, but, you know — because I’ll go back in and they’ll say, “Oh, the market just went down.”  But the market is getting close to the new highs that we created.  We have all the records.  We have every record.  But we’re getting close to that point again where we’ll create new records.\\nSo our country is doing very well, economically.  And we’ve done a lot.  But one of the things I said I have to do and I want to do is border security, because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into our country, much of it coming from the southern border.  When you look and when you listen to politicians — in particular, certain Democrats — they say it all comes through the port of entry.  It’s wrong.  It’s wrong.  It’s just a lie.  It’s all a lie.\\nThey say walls don’t work.  Walls work 100 percent.  Whether it’s El Paso — I really was smiling, because the other night I was in El Paso — we had a tremendous crowd, and — tremendous crowd.  And I asked the people — many of whom were from El Paso, but they came from all over Texas.  And I asked them.  I said, “Let me ask you, as a crowd: When the wall went up, was it better?”  You were there, some of you.  It was not only better; it was like 100 percent better.  You know what they did.\\nBut that’s only one example.  There are so many examples.  In El Paso, they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall.  And they had 23 murders.  It’s a lot of murders, but it’s not close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall, in Mexico.\\nSo everyone knows that walls work.  And there are better examples than El Paso, frankly.  You just take a look.  Almost everywhere.  Take a look at Israel.  They’re building another wall.  Their wall is 99.9 percent effective, they told me — 99.9 percent.  That’s what it would be with us, too.\\nThe only weakness is they go to a wall and then they go around the wall.  They go around the wall and in.  Okay?  That’s what it is.  It’s very simple.  And a big majority of the big drugs — the big drug loads — don’t go through ports of entry.  They can’t go through ports of entry.  You can’t take big loads because you have people — we have some very capable people; the Border Patrol, law enforcement — looking.\\nYou can’t take human traffic — women and girls — you can’t take them through ports of entry.  You can’t have them tied up in the backseat of a car or a truck or a van.  They open the door.  They look.  They can’t see three women with tape on their mouth or three women whose hands are tied.\\nThey go through areas where you have no wall.  Everybody knows that.  Nancy knows it.  Chuck knows it.  They all know it.  It’s all a big lie.  It’s a big con game.\\nYou don’t have to be very smart to know: You put up a barrier, the people come in, and that’s it.  They can’t do anything unless they walk left or right, and they find an area where there’s no barrier, and they come into the United States.  Welcome.\\nWe’ve detained more people.  Our border agents are doing such incredible work.  Our military has been incredible.  We put up barbed wire on top of certain old walls that were there.  We fixed the wall and we loaded it up with barbed wire.  It’s very successful.\\nBut our military has been fantastic, and I want to thank them.  And it’s very necessary.  We’ve broken up two caravans that are on their way.  They just are breaking.  They’re in the process of breaking up.  We have another one that we haven’t been able to break up yet.\\nWe’ve been actually working with Mexico much better than ever before.  I want to thank the President.  I want to thank Mexico.  They have their own problems.  They have the largest number of murders that they’ve ever had in their history — almost 40,000 murders.  Forty thousand.  And they got to straighten that out, and I think they will.\\nBut I just want to thank the President, because he’s been helping us with these monstrous caravans that have been coming up.  We had one that it was up to over 15,000 people.  It’s largely broken up.  Others have gotten through.  And, in Tijuana, you have a lot of people staying there.  If we didn’t have the wall up, and if we didn’t have the wall secured and strengthened, they would have walked right through; they’d be welcomed to the United States.\\nOne of the things we’d save tremendous — just a tremendous amount on would be sending the military.  If we had a wall, we don’t need the military because we’d have a wall.\\nSo I’m going to be signing a national emergency.  And it’s been signed many times before.  It’s been signed by other Presidents from 1977 or so.  It gave the Presidents the power.\\nThere’s rarely been a problem.  They sign it; nobody cares.  I guess they weren’t very exciting.  But nobody cares.  They sign it for far less important things, in some cases, in many cases.  We’re talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs.\\nWe have some of the greatest people I know.  They’ve been with me from the beginning of my campaign — almost from the first week.  The Angel Moms.  Unfortunately, we have new Angel Moms.  One incredible woman just showed me her daughter who — we’re talking about killed, in the year of ’18.  I said, “I haven’t seen you before.”  She said, “No, I’m new.”  I said, “That’s too bad.”  It’s too bad.  It’s so sad.\\nStand up, just for a second.  Show how beautiful your girl was.  Thank you.\\nI have such respect for these people.  Angel Moms, Angel Dads, Angel Families.  I have great respect for these people.  These are great people.  These are great people.  They’re fighting for their children that have been killed by people that were illegally in this country.\\nAnd the press doesn’t cover them; they don’t want to, incredibly.  And they’re not treated the way they should be.  They’re fighting for other people because they don’t want what happened to their children or husband or anybody.\\nWe have one young lady whose husband — please, stand up.  Your husband was just killed in Maryland.  Incredible man.  Just killed.  Beautiful children — won’t be seeing their father again.\\nThese are brave people.  These are people that — they don’t have to be here.  They don’t have to be doing this.  They’re doing it for other people.  So I just want to thank all of you for being here, okay?  I really do.  I want to thank you.  Incredible people.\\nLast year, 70,000 Americans were killed, at least — I think the number is ridiculously low — by drugs, including meth and heroin and cocaine, fentanyl.  And one of the things that I did with President Xi in China, when I met him in Argentina at a summit — before I even started talking about the trade — it was a trade meeting.  It went very well, but before I talked about trade, I talked about something more important.\\nI said, “Listen, we have tremendous amounts of fentanyl coming into our country.  It kills tens of thousands of people — I think far more than anybody registers.  And I’d love you to declare it a lethal drug and put it on your criminal list.”  And their criminal list is much tougher than our criminal list.  Their criminal list — a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty.  Our criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called, “How about a fine?”\\nAnd when I asked President Xi, I said, “Do you have a drug problem?”  “No, no, no.”  I said, “You have 1.4 billion people.  What do you mean you have no drug problem?”  “No, we don’t have a drug problem.”  I said, “Why?” “Death penalty.  We give death penalty to people that sell drugs.”  End of problem.\\nWhat do we do?  We set up blue ribbon committees.  Lovely men and women — they sit around a table, they have lunch, they eat, they dine, and they waste a lot of time.  So if we want to get smart, we can get smart.  You can end the drug problem.  You can end it a lot faster than you think.\\nBut President Xi has agreed to put fentanyl on his list of deadly, deadly drugs.  And it’s a criminal penalty.  And the penalty is death.  So that’s, frankly, one of the things I’m most excited about in our trade deal, if you want to know the truth.  I think maybe there’s no more important point.\\nWe’re going to make billions of dollars with this trade deal.  It’s going to be great for our country and great for China, I hope.  Their market is down close to 40 percent.  Our market is way up.  We’ve picked up, since my election, trillions of dollars of worth.  Trillions.  Many trillions.  And China has lost trillions of dollars.  But I want it to be good for China and I want it to be good for the United States.  So we’ll see what happens.\\nChina is coming here next week, by the way.  They’re coming home, the traders.  And then China is coming here next week.  And then I’ll be meeting with President Xi at some point after that to maybe — for some remaining deals.  We’ll make them directly, one-on-one, ourselves.\\nSo, we’re going to be signing today, and registering, national emergency.  And it’s a great thing to do because we have an invasion of drugs, invasion of gangs, invasion of people, and it’s unacceptable.\\nAnd by signing the national emergency — something signed many times by other Presidents — many, many times.  President Obama — in fact, we may be using one of the national emergencies that he signed, having to do with cartels.  Criminal cartels.  It’s a very good emergency that he signed.  And we’re going to use parts of it in our dealings on cartels.  So that would be a second national emergency.  But, in that case, it’s already in place.\\nAnd what we want — really want to do — is simple.  It’s not like it’s complicated.  It’s very simple: We want to stop drugs from coming into our country.  We want to stop criminals and gangs from coming into our country.  Nobody has done the job that we’ve ever done.  I mean, nobody has done the job that we’ve done on the border.\\nAnd in a way, what I did by creating such a great economy — and if the opposing party got in, this economy would be down the tubes.  You know, I hear a lot of people say, “Oh, well.  But maybe the previous administration…”  Let me tell you, the previous administration, it was heading south, and it was going fast.  We would have been down the tubes.  The regulations were strangling our country.  Unnecessary regulations.\\nBy creating such a strong economy — you just look at your televisions or see what’s going on today; it’s through the roof.  What happens is more people want to come, so we have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably we’ve ever had before.  And we’ve done an incredible job in stopping them, but it’s a massive number of people.\\nIf we had the wall, it would be very easy.  We would make up for the cost of the wall just in the cost of the fact that I would be able to have fewer people.  We wouldn’t need all of this incredible talent, some of whom are sitting in the first row.  You wouldn’t need all of this incredible talent.  We would get — we would get thousands of law enforcement people, including Border Patrol.  You put them in different areas, you have them doing different things.  Law enforcement and Border Patrol.\\nAnd I want to thank law enforcement, and I want to thank Border Patrol, and I want to thank ICE.  ICE is abused by the press and by the Democrats.  And, by the way, we’re going to be taking care of ICE.  You know, we talk about the new bill.  We’re going to be taking care of ICE.  They wanted to get rid of ICE.  And the bill is just the opposite of that.  A lot of good things happened.\\nSo, that’s the story.  We want to have a safe country.  I ran on a very simple slogan: “Make America Great Again.”  If you’re going to have drugs pouring across the border, if you’re going to have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we don’t have a barrier, then very hard to make America great again.\\nBut we’ve done a fantastic job, but we haven’t been given the equipment.  We haven’t been given the walls.  And in the bill, by the way, they didn’t even fight us on most of the stuff.  Ports of entry.  We have so much money, we don’t know what to do with it.  I don’t know what to do with all the money they’re giving us.  It’s crazy.\\nThe only place they don’t want to give as much money — $1,375,000,000.  Sounds like a lot, but it’s not so much, although we’re putting it to much better use than it used to be.  A lot of the past administrations, they had — it was easy to get, and they didn’t build or they didn’t do what they could have done.  It would have been great.  It would have been great to have done it earlier, but I was a little new to the job, a little new to the profession.\\nAnd we had a little disappointment for the first year and a half.  People that should have stepped up did not step up.  They didn’t step up, and they should have.  Would have been easy.  Not that easy, but it would have been a lot easier.  But some people didn’t step up.  But we’re stepping up now.\\nSo we have a chance of getting close to $8 billion.  Whether it’s $8 billion or $2 billion or $1.5 billion, it’s going to build a lot of wall.  We’re getting it done.  We’re right now in construction with wall in some of the most important areas.  And we have renovated a tremendous amount of wall, making it just as good as new.  That’s where a lot of the money has been spent — on renovation.  In fact, we were restricted to renovating, which is okay.  But we’re going to run out of areas that we can renovate pretty soon.  So — and we need new wall.\\nSo I want to thank everybody for being here.  I want to thank, in particular, the Angel Moms and Dads for being here.  Thank you very much.  We have great respect for you.  The real country, our real country — the people that really love our country, they love you.  So I just want you to know that.  I know how hard you fight and I know how hard a fight you’re having.\\nI also want to thank all of the law enforcement for the job you do.  Believe me, our country loves you and they respect you greatly.  And we’re giving you a lot of surplus.  We’re giving you surplus military equipment, which a lot of people didn’t like giving, previous to this administration.  But hundreds of millions of dollars of surplus equipment.  And as we get it, as you know, we send it down.  And you have much better protection.  But I really appreciate you being here.\\nSo the order is signed.  And I’ll sign the final papers as soon as I get into the Oval Office.  And we will have a national emergency, and then we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the Ninth Circuit, even though it shouldn’t be there.  And we will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we’ll get another bad ruling.  And then we’ll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we’ll get a fair shake.  And we’ll win in the Supreme Court, just like the ban.  They sued us in the Ninth Circuit, and we lost, and then we lost in the appellate division, and then we went to the Supreme Court, and we won.\\nAnd it was very interesting, because yesterday they were talking about the ban.  Because we have a ban.  It’s very helpful.  Madam Secretary, is that right?  Without the ban, we’d have a bigger problem.  We have a ban on certain areas, certain countries, depending on what’s going on in the world.  And we won.\\nBut somebody said, “President Trump lost on the ban.”  Well, he was right; I lost at the lower court.  He — he didn’t say that we ultimately won at the United States Supreme Court.  They didn’t want to say that.  They didn’t want to go that far.  They were saying how I lost.  The person sitting right up here — “Donald Trump lost on the ban.”  Yeah, I did.  And then I lost a second time; you should have said that, too.  And then it went to the Supreme Court and I won.  Didn’t want to take it that far.  But we won on the ban and we won on other things, too.\\nThe probably easiest one to win is on declaring a national emergency, because we’re declaring it for virtual invasion purposes: drugs, traffickers, and gangs.  And one of the things, just to finish: We have removed thousands of MS-13 gang monsters.  Thousands.  They’re out of this country.  We take them out by the thousands.  And they are monsters.\\nOkay.  Do you have any questions?  Yeah.  John, go ahead.\\nQ        Mr. President — (inaudible).\\nAIDE:  Yes, we do.  There you go.\\nQ        You were prepared.  Mr. President, a lot of the money —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Were you saying I was prepared?\\nQ        With the microphone and prepared for questions.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I thought you meant I was prepared.  I couldn’t believe you said that.\\nQ        (Laughs.)  No, no, no.  (Laughter.)\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  People don’t like saying that.\\nQ        You were prepared for questions.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I am prepared.  I’m always prepared.\\nQ        A lot of the money that goes to count toward your $8 billion is money that’s being reprogrammed in the DOD budget.  How can you guarantee to military families and to our men and women of the military that none of the money that would be reprogrammed to a wall will take away from other technology, other renovations, construction that is desperately needed in our military?\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  So, John, we had certain funds that are being used at the discretion of generals, at the discretion of the military.  Some of them haven’t been allocated yet, and some of the generals think that this is more important.  I was speaking to a couple of them.  They think this is far more important than what they were going to use it for.  I said, “What were you going to use it for?”  And I won’t go into details, but it didn’t sound too important to me.\\nPlus, if you think, I’ve gotten $700 billion for the military in year one, and then last year, $716 billion.  And we’re rebuilding our military, but we have a lot.  And under the previous administration, our military was depleted — badly depleted.  And they weren’t spending — I mean, they had a much less — they had a much smaller amount of money.\\nSo when I got $700 billion, and then $716 billion — and this year, it’s going to be pretty big too, because there’s few things more important than our military.  You know, I’m a big deficit believer and all of that, but before we really start focusing on certain things, we have to build up our military.  It was very badly depleted.  And we’re buying all new jetfighters, all new missiles, all new defensive equipment.  We have — we’ll soon have a military like we’ve never had before.\\nBut when you think about the kind of numbers you’re talking about — so you have $700 billion, $716 billion — when I need $2 billion, $3 billion of out that for a wall — which is a very important instrument, very important for the military because of the drugs that pour in.  And as you know, we have specific rules and regulations where they have drugs, and what you can do in order to stop drugs.  And that’s part of it, too.\\nWe’re taking a lot of money from that realm also.  But when you have that kind of money going into the military, this is a very, very small amount that we’re asking for.\\nYeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  ABC.  Not NBC.  I like ABC a little bit more — not much.  Come on, ABC.  Not much.  Pretty close.\\nQ        Mr. President, what do you say to those, including some of your Republican allies, who say that you are violating the Constitution with this move and setting a bad precedent that will be abused by possibly Democratic Presidents in the future?  Marco Rubio has made this point.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, not too many people.  Yeah.  Not too many people have said that.  But the courts will determine that.\\nLook, I expect to be sued.  I shouldn’t be sued.  Very rarely do you get sued when you do national emergency.  And then other people say, “Oh, if you use it for this, now what are we using it for?”  We got to get rid of drugs and gangs and people.  It’s an invasion.  We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country that we stop, but it’s very hard to stop.  With a wall, it would be very easy.\\nSo I think that we will be very successful in court.  I think it’s clear.  And the people that say we create precedent — well, what do you have?  Fifty-six?  There are a lot of times — well, that’s creating precedent.  And many of those are far less important than having a border.  If you don’t have a border, you don’t have a country.\\nYou know, we fight — before I got here — we fight all over the world to create borders for countries, but we don’t create a border for our own country.\\nSo I think what will happen is, sadly, we’ll be sued, and sadly, it’ll go through a process.  And, happily, we’ll win — I think.\\nGo ahead.  Let’s go.  Let’s hear it, NBC.  Come on.\\nQ        Thank you, Mr. President.  I just want to say, in the past, when President Obama tried to use executive action as it related to immigration, you said, “The whole concept of executive order, it’s not the way the country is supposed to be run.”  You said, “You’re supposed to go through Congress and make a deal.”  Will you concede that you were unable to make the deal that you had promised in the past, and that the deal you’re ending up with now from Congress is less than what you could have had before a 35-day shutdown?\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No.  Look, I went through Congress.  I made a deal.  I got almost $1.4 billion when I wasn’t supposed to get one dollar — not one dollar.  “He’s not going to get one dollar.”  Well, I got $1.4 billion.  But I’m not happy with it.  I also got billions and billions of dollars for other things — port of entries, lots of different things.  The purchase of drug equipment.  More than we were even requesting.\\nIn fact, the primary fight was on the wall.  Everything else, we have so much, as I said, I don’t know what to do with it we have so much money.  But on the wall, they skimped.\\nSo I did — I was successful, in that sense, but I want to do it faster.  I could do the wall over a longer period of time.  I didn’t need to do this.  But I’d rather do it much faster.  And I don’t have to do it for the election.  I’ve already done a lot of wall, for the election — 2020.  And the only reason we’re up here talking about this is because of the election, because they want to try and win an election, which it looks like they’re not going to be able to do.  And this is one of the ways they think they can possibly win, is by obstruction and a lot of other nonsense.\\nAnd I think that I just want to get it done faster, that’s all.\\nOkay.  Yes, ma’am, go ahead.\\nQ        Thank you, Mr. President.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\\nQ        Roberta Rampton from Reuters.  I wanted to ask about China.  Do you feel that enough progress has been made in the talks to head off the increase in tariffs scheduled for March 1?\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, you’re talking to the wrong person, because I happen to like tariffs, okay?  I mean, we’re taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China.  And our steel industry now, as an example, we tax dumped steel — much of it comes from China — at 25 percent.  Our steel industry is so vibrant now again, they’re building plants all over the United States.  It’s a beautiful thing.  And from a defensive standpoint, and from any standpoint, you need steel.\\nYou know, you can do without certain industries.  Our country cannot do without steel.\\nSo, I love tariffs, but I also love them to negotiate.  And right now, China is paying us billions of dollars a year in tariffs.  And I haven’t even started.\\nNow, here’s the thing: If we make a deal, they won’t have to pay.  You know, it’ll be a whole different story.  They won’t be paying that, but we’ll have a fair deal.  There won’t be intellectual property theft.  There won’t be so many other things that have gone on.  And no other President has done this.  No other — you know, we didn’t have a deal with China.  You had the WTO, one of the worst trade deals ever made — probably even worse than NAFTA, if that’s believable, which, you know, hard to believe, because I think NAFTA was just a disaster.  It was a total disaster for our country.\\nAnd now we made the USMCA, which is going to be a terrific — a great deal.  And, by the way, the USMCA, from Mexico — that’s United States, Mexico, Canada — that’s where the money is coming from, not directly but indirectly, for the wall.  And nobody wants to talk about that.  Because we’re saving billions and billions of dollars a year, if Congress approves that deal.\\nNow, they might now want to approve a deal just because they’ll say — one of the things I’m thinking of doing — this has never been done before: No matter how good a deal I make with China, if they sell me Beijing for one dollar, if they give me 50 percent of their land and every ship that they’ve built over the last two years — which is a lot — and they give them to me free, the Democrats will say, “What a lousy deal; that’s a terrible deal.”\\nLike, ZTE, I got a billion — more than a billion-dollar penalty in a short period of time.  And the Democrats said, “Oh, should’ve gotten more.”  When I made that deal, I said, “This is incredible.”  I just got — I got over a billion-dollar penalty, plus they had to change their board of directors.  They had to change their top management.  But they had to pay over a billion dollars.  I said, “What a deal.”  It took like a week.  And the Democrats didn’t even know there was a problem with ZTE.\\nI’m the one that find them.  I’m the one that settled it.  Over a billion dollars.  And President Xi called me and he said it would be important to him if they could get a deal.  And we made a deal — paid — like, in a short period of time.\\nThe Democrats went out and said, “Oh, they should’ve done better.”  So what I’m thinking of doing is getting Chuck Schumer, getting Nancy Pelosi, having them bring two or three of their brilliant representatives.  And we’ll all go down together, and what we’ll do is we’ll negotiate.  I’ll put them in the room and let them speak up.  Because any deal I make with China, if it’s the great — it’s going to be better than any deal that anybody ever dreamt possible, or I’m not going to have a deal.  It’s a very simple.\\nBut any deal I make with China, Schumer is going to stand up and say, “Oh, it should’ve been better.  It should’ve been better.”  And you know what?  That’s not acceptable to me.  So I’m thinking about doing something very different.  I don’t think it’s ever been — I just don’t want to be second-guessed.  But that’s not even second-guess; that’s called politics.  Sadly, I’d probably do the same thing to them, okay?\\nBut any deal I make toward the end, I’m going to bring Schumer — at least offer him — and Pelosi.  I’m going to say, “Please join me on the deal.”\\nAnd, by the way, I just see our new Attorney General is sitting in the front row.  Please stand up, Bill.  (Applause.)  Such an easy job he’s got.  He’s got the easiest job in government.  Thank you and congratulations.  That was a great vote yesterday.  Thank you very much.\\nQ        Mr. President —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yes, go ahead.  Go ahead.\\nQ        In your remarks, sir, you said that you were too new to politics, earlier in your administration, when you would’ve preferred that this be done.  Is that an admission of how you might be changing on the job?  And —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m learning.  I mean, I am learning.  Don’t forget, it’s not like I’ve done this for — a senator came into my office and said, “Sir, I’ve been running for office for 30 years.  I’ve won seven out of seven.  I did lose a couple when I was younger.”  I said, “Well, I’ve won one out of one.  But, you know, I never did politics before.  Now I do politics.”  I will tell you, I’m very disappointed at certain people, a particular one, for not having pushed this faster.\\nQ        Are you referring to Speaker Ryan, sir?\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  But I’ve learned — who?\\nQ        Speaker Ryan.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Let’s not talk about it.\\nQ        Okay.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  What difference does it make?  But they should have pushed it faster.  They should have pushed it harder.  And they didn’t.  They didn’t.\\nIf they would have, it would have been a little bit better.  In the meantime, I’ve built a lot of wall.  I have a lot of money, and I’ve built a lot of wall.  But it would’ve been nice to have gotten done.  And I would like to see major immigration reform, and maybe that’s something we can all work on, Bill, where we all get together and do major immigration reform — not just for a wall, for a barrier; for port of entry, for other things.\\nWe have a real problem.  We have catch-and-release.  You catch a criminal and you have to release them.  We have so many other things.  You have chain migration, where a bad person comes in, brings 22 or 23 or 35 of his family members — because he has his mother, his grandmother, his sister, his cousin, his uncle — they’re all in.\\nYou know what happened on the West Side Highway.  That young wise guy drove over and killed eight people and horribly injured — nobody talks about that — horribly — like, loss of legs and arms — going 60 miles an hour, he made a right turn into a park on the West Side Highway, along the Hudson River in New York.  He had many people brought in because he was in the United States.  It’s called chain migration.\\nAnd then you have the lottery.  It’s a horror show, because when countries put people into the lottery, they’re not putting you in; they’re putting some very bad people in the lottery.  It’s common sense.  If I ran a country, and if I have a lottery system of people going to the United States, I’m not going to put in my stars; I’m going to put in people I don’t want.  The lottery system is a disaster.  I’m stuck with it.\\nQ        Mr. President, could you tell us —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It should have — wait.  It should have never happened.  Okay.\\nQ        Mr. President, could you tell us to what degree some of the outside conservative voices helped to shape your views on this national emergency?\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I would talk about it.  Look, Sean Hannity has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do.  Not of me.  If I changed my views, he wouldn’t be with me.\\nRush Limbaugh — I think he’s a great guy.  Here’s a guy who can speak for three hours without a phone call.  Try doing that sometime.  For three hours, he speaks.  He’s got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world.  I mean, this guy is unbelievable.  Try speaking for three hours without taking calls.  Taking calls is easy.  “Okay, I’ll answer this one.  I’ll answer that one.”  He goes for three hours, and he’s got an audience that’s fantastic.\\nQ        Should they be —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Wait —\\nQ        Should they be deciding policy, sir?\\nTHE PRESIDENT:   They don’t decide policy.  In fact, if I went opposite — I mean, they have somebody — Ann Coulter.  I don’t know her.  I hardly know her.  I haven’t spoken to her in way over a year.  But the press loves saying “Ann Coulter.”  Probably, if I did speak to her, she’d be very nice.  I just don’t have the time to speak to her.  I would speak to her; I have nothing against her.\\nIn fact, I like her for one reason: When they asked her, like right at the beginning, who was going to win the election, she said, “Donald Trump.”  And the two people that asked her that question smiled.  They said, “You’re kidding, aren’t you?”  “Nope.  Donald Trump.”\\nSo I like her, but she’s off the reservation.  But anybody that knows her understands that.  But I haven’t spoken to her.  I don’t follow her.  I don’t talk to her.  But the press loves to bring up the name “Ann Coulter.”  And you know what?  I think she’s fine.  I think she’s good.  But I just don’t speak to her.\\nLaura has been great.  Laura Ingraham.  Tucker Carlson has been great.  I actually have a couple people on CNN that have been very good.  I have some on MSNBC.  The other day, they did a great report of me.  I said, “Where the hell did that come from?”  I think it was the only one in over a year.\\nSo the crazy thing is, I just had, as you know, Rasmussen — 52 percent in the polls.  It’s my highest poll number.  And people get what we’re doing.  They get it.  They really get it.  And I’m honored by it.\\nYes.  Jim Acosta.\\nQ        Thank you, Mr. President.  I wonder if you could comment on this disconnect that we seem to have in this country, where you are presenting information about what’s happening at the border — calling it an “invasion,” talking about women with duct tape over their mouths, and so on — and yet there’s a lot of reporting out there, there’s a lot of crime data out there, there’s a lot of Department of Homeland Security data out there that shows border crossings at a near-record low —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s because of us.  But it’s still —\\nQ        — that shows undocumented immigrants committing crime at lower levels —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me.  It’s still massive numbers of crossings.\\nQ        — that shows undocumented criminals — or undocumented immigrants committing crime at lower levels than native-born Americans.  What do you say —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You don’t really believe that stat, do you?  Do you really believe that stat?\\nQ        What do you — well, let me ask you this —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Take a look at our federal prisons.\\nQ        I believe in facts and statistics and data, but —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay?  Any more?  Quick, let’s go.\\nQ        Let me just ask you this: What do you say to your critics who say that you are creating a national emergency, that you’re concocting a national emergency here in order to get your wall because you couldn’t get it through other ways?\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I ask the Angel Moms: What do you think?  Do you think I’m creating something?\\nAsk these incredible women, who lost their daughters and their sons.  Okay?\\nPARTICIPANT:  This is real.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Because your question is a very political question because you have an agenda.  You’re CNN.  You’re fake news.  You have an agenda.  The numbers that you gave are wrong.\\nTake a look at our federal prison population.  See how many of them, percentage-wise, are illegal aliens.  Just see.  Go ahead and see.  It’s a fake question.\\nYes.  Go ahead.\\nQ        Can I ask a follow-up?\\nQ        Thank you, Mr. President.  Just to follow up on that, unifying crime reporting statistics — numbers from your own Border Patrol, numbers from this government — show that the amount of illegal immigrants are down, there is not violence on the border, and that most —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  There’s not violence on the border?\\nQ        There’s not as much violence as —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, really?\\nQ        Let me — wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You had 26 people killed —\\nQ        Let me finish the question, please.  Let me finish the question, please.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Two weeks ago, 26 people were killed in a gunfight on the border —\\nQ        I understand what you’re — I understand what you’re saying.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — a mile away from where I went.\\nQ        I was there.  I understand.  That’s not the question.  The question is —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Do we forget about that?\\nQ        No, I’m not forgetting about it.  I’m asking you to clarify where you get your numbers, because most of the DEA crime reporting statistics that we see show that drugs are coming across at the ports of entry, that illegal immigration is down, and the violence is down.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay.\\nQ        So what do you base your facts on?\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay, let me — come on, let’s go.  Sort of — sort of —\\nQ        And, secondly —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no.  You get one.  You get one.  Ready?\\nQ        Well, the second question is —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Just sit down.  Wait.  Sit down.  Sit down.\\nQ        Could you please answer it?\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Sit down.  You get one question.\\nI get my numbers from a lot of sources — like Homeland Security, primarily.  And the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster.  And you know what else is a disaster?  The numbers that come out of Homeland Security, Kirstjen, for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration: Billions and billions of dollars a month.  Billions and billions of dollars.  And it’s unnecessary.\\nQ        So your own government stats are wrong, are you saying?\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no.  I use many stats.  I use many stats.\\nQ        Could you share those stats with us?\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Let me tell you, you have stats that are far worse than the ones that I use.  But I use many stats, but I also use Homeland Security.\\nAll right, next question.\\nQ        And do you — wait a minute.  Just a quick follow-up.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.  No.  Go.  Please.\\nQ        Thank you, Mr. President.  I just want to bring you back to China for a second.  The White House put out a statement today talking about the March 1st deadline.  The other day, though, you gave the possibility that maybe this could slide.  Are you eyeing a possible extension — 30 days, maybe 60 days?  What is the status there?  Or is March 1st the deadline?\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Very good question.  So it’s a very big deal.  I guess you could say it’s like — must be the biggest deal ever made, if you think.  Trade with China, how big does that get?  Although if you look, the USCMA is right up there.  But it’s very complicated.  There are many, many points that we’re bringing up that nobody ever brought up or thought to bring up, but they’re very important, because we were on the wrong side of every one of them.\\nThere is a possibility that I will extend the date.  And if I do that, if I see that we’re close to a deal or the deal is going in the right direction, I would do that at the same tariffs that we’re charging now.  I would not increase the tariffs.\\nQ        Let me also ask you about the debt, sir, because it’s gone from a shade under $20 trillion from when you took office.  Now it’s a shade over $22 trillion and heading in the wrong direction.  What are your plans to reverse it?\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, it’s all about growth.  But before I —\\nQ        (Inaudible.)\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — really focus on that — and you have to remember, President Obama put on more debt on this country than every President in the history of our country combined.  So when I took over, we had one man that put on more debt than every other President combined.  Combine them all.  So you can’t be talking about that.  But I talk about it because I consider it very important.\\nBut first, I have to straighten out the military.  The military was depleted.  And if we don’t have a strong military — that hopefully we won’t have to use because it’s strong — if we don’t have a strong military, you don’t have to worry about debt; you have bigger problems.  So I have to straighten out the military.  That’s why I did the $700- and $716 billion.  But growth will straighten it out.\\nYou saw last month, the trade deficit went way down.  Everybody said, “What happened?”  Well, what’s happening is growth.  But before I can focus too much on that, a very big expense is military.  And we have no choice but to straighten out our military.\\nQ        Is growth the only answer, sir, or is (inaudible)?\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yes, ma’am, go ahead.\\nQ        Thank you, Mr. President.  On North Korea — back on the last summit, you guys came out with a pretty general agreement.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yes.\\nQ        I was wondering what you thought has, you know, been accomplished since the last summit.  And then —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  A lot.\\nQ        — are we going to be seeing anything concrete —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  A lot has been accomplished.  Okay.\\nQ        — on denuclearization.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  A lot has been accomplished.  We’re dealing with them, we’re talking to them.\\nWhen I came into office, I met right there, in the Oval Office, with President Obama.  And I sat in those beautiful chairs and we talked.  It was supposed to be 15 minutes.  As you know, it ended up being many times longer than that.\\nAnd I said, “What’s the biggest problem?”  He said, “By far, North Korea.”  And I don’t want to speak for him, but I believe he would have gone to war with North Korea.  I think he was ready to go to war.  In fact, he told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea.  And where are we now?  No missiles.  No rockets.  No nuclear testing.  We’ve learned a lot.\\nBut much more importantly than all of it — much more important — much, much more important that that is we have a great relationship.  I have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un.  And I’ve done a job.  In fact, I think I can say this: Prime Minister Abe of Japan gave me the most beautiful copy of a letter that he sent to the people who give out a thing called the Nobel Prize.  He said, “I have nominated you…” or “Respectfully, on behalf of Japan, I am asking them to give you the Nobel Peace Prize.”  I said, “Thank you.”  Many other people feel that way too.  I’ll probably never get it, but that’s okay.\\nThey gave it to Obama.  He didn’t even know what he got it for.  He was there for about 15 seconds and he got the Nobel Prize.  He said, “Oh, what did I get it for?”  With me, I probably will never get it.\\nBut if you look at Idlib Province in Syria, I stopped the slaughter of perhaps 3 million people.  Nobody talk about that.  They don’t talk about that.  Russia and Iran and Syria were going to go in and perhaps destroy 3 million people in order to get 45,000 terrorists.  And I heard about it from a woman who had her parents and her brothers living there, and she said, “Please, please.”  And I thought — I said, “No, it can’t happen.  What are you talking about?”  “No, they’re going to get…”  And I come home, and I read a certain paper where the story was there that they were actually forming to go into — to really — to really do big destruction.  And I put out a statement that “you better not do it.”\\nAnd in all fairness to Russia and Iran and Syria, they didn’t attack.  Or they’re doing it surgically, at least.  Saved a lot of people.  We do a lot of good work.  This administration does a tremendous job, and we don’t get credit for it.  But I think the people understand what we do.\\nSo Prime Minister Abe gave me — I mean, it’s the most beautiful five letter — five-page letter.  Nobel Prize.  He sent it to them.  You know why?  Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan.  And they had alarms going off; you know that.  Now, all of a sudden, they feel good; they feel safe.  I did that.\\nAnd it was a very tough dialogue at the beginning.  Fire and fury.  Total annihilation.  “My button is bigger than yours” and “my button works.”  Remember that?  You don’t remember that.  And people said, “Trump is crazy.”  And you know what it ended up being?  A very good relationship.  I like him a lot and he likes me a lot.  Nobody else would have done that.\\nThe Obama administration couldn’t have done it.  Number one, they probably wouldn’t have done it.  And number two, they didn’t have the capability to do it.\\nSo I just want to thank everybody.  I want to wish our Attorney General great luck and speed, and enjoy your life.  (Laughter.)  Bill, good luck.  A tremendous reputation.  I know you’ll do a great job.  Thank you very much.  And thank you, everybody.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.\\n======================================================================\\n\\n\\nOctober 27, 2019: Statement on the the Death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\\nLast night, the United States brought the world’s number one terrorist leader to justice. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead.  He was the founder and leader of ISIS, the most ruthless and violent terror organization in the World.  The United States has been searching for Baghdadi for many years.  Capturing or killing Baghdadi has been the top national security priority of my Administration.  U.S. Special Operations forces executed a dangerous and daring nighttime raid into Northwestern Syria to accomplish this mission.\\nNo U.S. personnel were lost in the operation, while a large number of Baghdadi’s fighters and companions were killed with him.  He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming.  The compound had been cleared by this time, with people either surrendering or being shot and killed.  Eleven young children were moved out of the house un-injured.  The only ones remaining were Baghdadi in the tunnel, who had dragged three children with him to certain death.  He reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children.  His body was mutilated by the blast, but test results gave certain and positive identification.\\nThe thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, panic and dread – terrified of the American Forces bearing down.\\nWe were in the compound for approximately 2 hours, and after the mission was accomplished we took highly sensitive material and information from the raid.\\nBaghdadi’s demise demonstrates America’s relentless pursuit of terrorist leaders, and our commitment to the enduring and total defeat of ISIS!\\nThe reach of America is long.  As you know, last month we announced that we recently killed Hamza Bin Laden, the very violent son of Osama Bin Laden, who was saying very bad things.\\nHe was the heir apparent to Al Qaeda. Terrorists who oppress and murder innocent people should never sleep soundly, knowing that we will completely destroy them. These savage monsters will not escape their fate – and they will not escape the final judgement of God.\\nBaghdadi has been on the run for many years, long before I took office. At my direction, as Commander-in-Chief, the United States obliterated his ‘caliphate’ in March of this year.  Today’s events are another reminder that we will continue to pursue the remaining ISIS terrorists to their brutal end.\\nBaghdadi and the losers who worked with him – in some cases people who had no idea what they were getting into and how dangerous and unglamorous it was – killed many people.  Their murder of innocent Americans Jim Foley, Steven Sotloff, Peter Kassig, and Kayla Mueller were especially heinous.  The shocking publicized murder of a Jordanian pilot who was burned alive in a cage for all to see, and the execution of Christians in Libya and Egypt, as well as the genocidal mass murder of Yazidis, rank ISIS among the most depraved organizations in history.\\nThe forced religious conversions, the orange suits prior to many beheadings, all of which were openly displayed for the world – this was all Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s work.  He was vicious and violent, and he died in a vicious and violent way, as a coward, running and crying.  This raid was impeccable, and could only have taken place with the acknowledgement and help of certain other nations and people.\\nI want to thank the nations of Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq, and I also want to thank the Syrian Kurds for certain support they were able to give us. Thank you as well to the great intelligence professionals who helped make this very successful journey possible.\\nI want to thank the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines involved in last night’s operation.  You are the very best there is anywhere in the world.  I want to thank General Mark Milley and our Joint Chiefs of Staff, and I also want to thank our professionals who work in other agencies of the United States government and were critical to the mission’s success.\\nLast night was a great night for the United States and for the World. A brutal killer, one who has caused so much hardship and death, was violently eliminated – he will never again harm another innocent man, woman or child.  He died like a dog.  He died like a coward.  The world is now a much safer place.\\nGod bless the United States of America!\\n======================================================================\\n\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump interviewed by 'Meet the Press' moderator Kristen Welker\\n\\n\\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nPresident Trump, welcome back to Meet the Press. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nThank you very much.\\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nThank you so much for being here to mark your first 100 days in office. It has been an incredibly busy 100 days. You’ve signed more than 140 executive orders. You’ve been focused on the border, the economy, foreign policy. What is your biggest goal in the next 100 days?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, I think we’re going to see a lot of results. We’ve already seen them. On the border, we have the best border in the history of our country. It was 99.999, and nobody ever thought that was possible. In fact, Biden, if you remember, said he has to get legislation. And I said, “No, you just need a new president.” And I guess I was right. We have the best border we’ve ever had. We’re doing great on illegal immigration. We are being hit hard by judges that I think they’re trying to take away the power of the presidency. I was elected in a massive landslide and a big, you know, big vote. We won the swing states. We won the popular vote. We won the district votes by tremendous numbers. We won everything. And one of the reasons — one of the primary reasons I was elected was to get people out of our country that were allowed. We have prisoners. We have murderers. We have terrorists in our country. We have people from mental institutions that are seriously insane. They all came in through Biden’s open border policy. And I was elected to get them out and to seal the border, but to get them out. And we’ll have judges, they’re activist judges. They’re saying, “Well, you know, you don’t have the right to take out murderers and — and people that you don’t even want to talk about.” These are really some really bad criminal people. And they’re here illegally. So, you know they talk about — your next question will be due process. But they talk about due process, but do you get due process when you’re here illegally?                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWe’re going to talk about all of that. We are going to talk about deportation. But I want to start on the economy, sir, which obviously — obviously the biggest issue for voters. We got new numbers today, better than expected job numbers.                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nMuch better.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAt the same time, the economy shrank in the first quarter. You’ve been arguing all week that this is President Biden’s economy. Is this now your economy, sir?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, I think certain aspects of it are. Costs are. I was able to get down the costs. But even that, it takes a while to get them down, but we got them down good. We lost 5 to 6 billion dollars a day with Biden. Five to 6 billion. And I’ve got that down to a great number right now in a very — in a record time. You know, we’re talking about 100 days. But just think of what that is. Five billion dollars a day we’re losing on trade. And we were very tough with China, as you know. We put 145% tariff on. Nobody’s ever heard of such a thing. And we’ve essentially cut off trade relationships by putting that much of a tariff on. And that’s okay. We’ve gone cold turkey. That means that we’re not losing. You know, we lost a trillion dollars to China. A trillion dollars. That means we’re not losing a trillion dollars when we go cold turkey because we’re not doing business with them right now. And they want to make a deal. They want to make a deal very badly. We’ll see how that all turns out, but it’s got to be a fair deal. But think of it. We were losing a trillion dollars. And that was a big part of the 5 million dollars a day.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAnd I want to talk about China, but just staying on this idea of the economy. On the eve of your inauguration, the stock market spiked. You called it the “Trump Effect.” Are you —                                \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nIt spiked because I was elected president. It didn’t spike because of anybody else. It spiked because they see what I’m going to do. They know what I’m going to do with the tariffs and everything else. And I think it’s actually working out better than we anticipated. Did you see oil prices? Did you see gasoline is now below, in many cases, in many states, below 2 dollars a gallon? $1.98, $1.99, $1.97?                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWell, my question, sir, is you — when the stock market spiked, you said this is the “Trump effect.” When the numbers weren’t so good earlier this week, you said it’s the Biden effect. Are you only taking ownership of the good numbers and not the bad numbers?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, I think he did a lot of very bad things. And despite some of the bad things, we’re overcoming them. But he was bad on the border. He was bad on the economy. We had the worst inflation in the history of our country. Look, Biden gave us the worst inflation in the history of our country. People — it didn’t matter what they made because they were losing their shirt because of costs. Now take a look at what happened. Oil is down. Gasoline is down. Groceries are down. Eggs. You were the one that asked me. You asked me about eggs. It was the first week. I didn’t even know anything about what you — we were talking about. Egg prices were so high, you couldn’t buy eggs. They didn’t have any eggs. And they said, “Easter is going to be a disaster.” Well, we had Easter at the White House, and we had thousands of eggs. And they were down 87%.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYeah. A lot of that, of course, spike was because of bird flu. But when does it become —                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, I don’t know —                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– the Trump economy?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n– what it was. Why do you say that?                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWell, tell me. When —                                \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWe had the same bird flu as he had.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWhen does it become the Trump economy?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nIt partially is right now. And I really mean this. I think the good parts are the Trump economy and the bad parts are the Biden economy because he’s done a terrible job. He did a terrible job on everything, from his autopen — which I’m sure he knew nothing about, some of the things he was supposedly signing — to immigration. You look at what happened with immigration, how bad it was. Think of it. We have murderers, 11,888 murderers, many of them murdered more than one person. Think of that. And they’re in our country. Now, we’ve gotten a lot of them out, and we know who many of them are. And we’re on the hunt. But why would anybody do that? Why would anybody — who could do such a thing where they’d allow hundreds of thousands, and even millions of people into our country — or criminals and murderers at the highest level. Who would do this?                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nBut, sir, you acknowledge when you announced your tariffs, for example, the stock market dropped. It’s been volatile. It has —                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell —                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– since gone up.                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n– it is, but now it’s —                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nDo you take responsibility —                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nLook at today. I take responsibility.                \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– for that? Yeah. Do you take responsibility when it drops?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nUltimately, I take responsibility for everything. But I’ve only just been here for a little more than three months. But the stock market, look at what’s happened in the last short period of time. Didn’t it have nine or ten days in a row, or 11 days, where it’s gone up? And the tariffs have just started kicking in. And we’re doing really well. Psychologically, I mean, the fake news was giving me such press on the tariffs. The tariffs are going to make us rich. We’re going to be a very rich country.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nSo let’s talk about the tariffs. And I want to ask you about something you said this week. Got a lot of attention. You were at your Cabinet meeting. You said, quote — I’m going to quote what you said — “Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.” Are you saying that your tariffs will cause some prices to go up?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo. I think tariffs are going to be great for us because it’s going to make us rich.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nBut you said some dolls are going to cost more.                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nSure.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nIsn’t that an acknowledgment —                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI don’t think —                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– that some prices —                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n– children —                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– will go up?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI don’t think that a beautiful baby girl needs — that’s 11 years old — needs to have 30 dolls. I think they can have three dolls or four dolls because what we were doing with China was just unbelievable. We had a trade deficit of hundreds of billions of dollars with China.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWhen you say, “They could have three dolls instead of 30 dolls,” are you saying you’re —                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI’m saying they don’t need to have 30 dolls —                                \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– that Americans could see empty store shelves?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo. No, I’m not saying that. I’m just saying they don’t need to have 30 dolls. They can have three. They don’t need to have 250 pencils. They can have five.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nBut you’re basically saying there could be some supply shortages —                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI’m basically saying —                                \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– because of the tariffs.                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n– we don’t have to waste money on a trade deficit with China for things we don’t need, for junk that we don’t need.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWell, prices are already going up on some popular items —                                \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWait, whoa, whoa, whoa.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– from tires to strollers —                \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWhoa, whoa. This is such a dishonest interview already.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nNo, no.                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nPrices are down on groceries. Prices are down for oil. Prices are down for all energy. Prices are down at tremendous numbers for gasoline. And let me tell you, when you have — the big thing, what he did, he spent like a stupid person, which he was. But he spent like a very stupid person. And that was bad for inflation. But what really killed us with inflation was the price of energy. It went up to $3.90, even $4. And in California, $5 and $6. Right? Okay. I have it down to $1.98 in many states right now. When you go that much lower on energy — which is ahead of my prediction because I really thought I could get it down into the $2.50s — we have it down at $1.98 in numerous places. But when you say costs are going up, even mortgage rates are going down. You know, we have mortgage rates —                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nBut let me give you some examples. These are — I mean, these are actual examples. So you’re saying the prices that are going down. Some prices are going up. Tires, strollers, some clothing in the wake of your tariffs —                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nExcuse me. That’s peanuts compared to —                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWell —                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n– energy. Energy is 60% of the cost.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nBut, sir, you campaigned —                                \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nEnergy is a big —                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– on a promise to bring prices down on day one.                                \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, I don’t know, when you say strollers are going up, what kind of a thing? I’m saying that gasoline is going down. Gasoline is thousands of times more important than a stroller or some place?                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nBut what do you say to Americans who say they voted for you because they want and they need relief right now?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nAnd they’re getting it.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nRight now? What about those —                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nEven mortgage rates. It was just announced —                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– different items I just mentioned?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n– mortgage rates are going down, despite the fact that we have a stubborn Fed.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nBut you said dolls — even dolls could cost a couple bucks more.                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nMaybe they might. But you don’t need to have, as I said, 35 dolls. You can have two, three, four, and save a lot of money. We don’t need to feed the beast.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nI guess — you’re talking about this transition cost. How long should people expect that transition to last, Mr. President?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI can’t tell you that. I can tell you that we’re making a lot of money. We’re doing great. Again, we were losing more than $5 billion a day. $5 billion a day. You don’t talk about that. And right now, we’re going to be at a point very soon where we’re making money every day. Look —                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nHow soon?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n– we were losing hundreds of billions of dollars with China. Now we’re essentially not doing business with China. Therefore, we’re saving hundreds of billions of dollars. Very simple.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYou take me to my next question, which is about China. They’ve been making a number of public statements.                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nVery positive statements in the last 24 hours.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWell, and most recently, they said before talks could happen, the U.S. would need to remove unilateral tariffs. Would you consider dropping the tariffs to get China to the negotiating table?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo. They — first of all, you’re giving me a statement that was said a week ago. You’re not giving the statement that was said today.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nI have May 2nd, Chinese Commerce Ministry.                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nDo you know what they say today?                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n“If the U.S. wants to negotiate, it should show sincerity –”                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n“We’re looking forward — ”                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n“ — by preparing to take actions in correcting its mistakes and canceling the unilateral tariffs.”                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo, no, no. They made — first of all, they made numerous statements.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYes. They’ve made numerous statements.                                \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYou know how many people speak for China?                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYes.                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nIt’s like, you have 15 different —                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nThey’ve made numerous statements —                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI can give you a statement for any occasion.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYes. Yes, yes.                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nBut they said today they want to talk. Look, China — and I don’t like this. I’m not happy about this. China’s getting killed right now. They’re getting absolutely destroyed. Their factories are closing. Their unemployment is going through the roof. I’m not looking to do that to China. Now, at the same time, I’m not looking to have China make hundreds of billions of dollars and build more ships and more army tanks and more airplanes.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nSo you’re not prepared — just to be very clear, you’re not dropping the tariffs against China to get them to the negotiating table? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP: \\nWhy would I —  \\nKRISTEN WELKER: \\nThose tariffs are staying on?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWhy would I do that?                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWould you lower them?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nAt some point, I’m going to lower them because otherwise, you could never do business with them. And they want to do business very much. Look, their economy is really doing badly. Their economy is collapsing.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nSo small businesses say they are being hurt by the Chinese tariffs. And some could be forced to shut down.                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nAnd many businesses are being helped.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAre you considering —                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nLook at the automobile —                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– tariff relief for small businesses?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWhy do you always mention that. You know, you pick up a couple of little businesses. What about the car business? They’re going to make a fortune because of the tariffs. Do you know that the union, the head of the union, who was no fan of mine, Fain, Shawn Fain I guess his name is, right? He didn’t endorse me. The Teamsters did. A lot of people did. A lot of unions did. But he didn’t. He couldn’t stand me. Now he’s saying, “Wow. What Trump’s done for the automobile, I can’t believe it.” I assume he’s going to probably now say — the next thing he can say is, “I endorse this guy. He’s the greatest I’ve ever seen.” He can’t believe it’s happened. He said, “We’ve been waiting 40 years for somebody to do what Trump is doing.” So why don’t you mention the big car industry instead of mentioning somebody that’s doing strollers?                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWell, I’m just asking you about small businesses. Are there any discussions about giving any relief to small businesses?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nThey’re not going to need it.  \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nOkay. Are these — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP: \\nThey’re going to make so much money —                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAre these tariffs —                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n– if you build your product here. Remember, there are no tariffs if you build your product here. It’s very easy. It’s very simple.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAre these tariffs permanent, Mr. President?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nDepends on what you’re talking about. One of the things that is going to bring, and has brought — so I think we probably have close to $9 trillion of investments coming into this country. If you look at other presidents, there’s never been anything like that. This is over a period of two months. You’ve got to give me a little break on the one month because we’re three months. But, you know, let’s say we had to get started. We had a lot of fake news at the beginning, so we had to beat that down. But so let’s say in two months. So in just a short period of time — a matter of a couple of months — we have the largest number ever in history invested in the United States and committed. We have between, guaranteed, spoken for and people that are going to make a decision and announce it pretty soon, close to $9 trillion. We’ve never had anything close. Now, that’s Apple building $500 billion worth of plants. They always built their plants in China. Now they’re building their plants over here. That’s the biggest computer company, the biggest chip company in the world. You know, the chip company from Taiwan, which is the biggest in the world, is committed for $500 billion. Another one’s committed for $300 billion. We have companies, nobody’s ever seen anything like it. Let me tell you the other thing, very importantly — automobile companies. Plant, after plant, after plant: Toyota, Honda, Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, I mean, nobody’s ever seen anything like it. And I don’t like this, but it happens to be. They’re stopping work in Mexico, and they’re stopping work in Canada, and they’re all moving here.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nThis is important though. You’re not taking the possibility that these tariffs could be permanent off the table — some of them?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo, I wouldn’t do that because if somebody thought they were going to come off the table, why would they build in the United States?                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nLet me ask you about —                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYou understand that, right?                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYeah. No, I mean, that’s why I’m asking because there’s a lot of, I think, uncertainty for CEOs, for business owners. They want to know are these tariffs —                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nSee, I don’t think there is uncertainty.                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– permanent?                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI think there’s only uncertainty in the fake news. I don’t think there’s uncertainty. I mean, I’ve been very rigid, very strong on it. But I will say I have — I’m flexible. Like, with respect to parts made outside of the country, I gave the automobile companies a little extra time. You know, you’re talking about 15%, and then 10% of the parts made — put in a car. I gave them a little extra time without penalizing them. And I did that only to help, you know, companies. We’re looking to help companies. We want them to thrive and to hire a lot of people and that’s what’s happening. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nLet me ask you about some of what Wall Street has said. Some people on Wall Street have expressed concerns that the possibility of a recession is increasing. And I want to know what you think about that. Are you comfortable with the country potentially dipping into a recession for a period of time if you are able to achieve your long term goals?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, you know, you say some people on Wall Street say, well, I’ll tell you something else. Some people on Wall Street say that we’re going to have the greatest economy in history. Why don’t you talk about them? Because some people on Wall Street say this is the greatest —               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWell, that’s what I’m getting at —               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n– thing that ever happened.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nThat’s what I’m getting at though. It’s —               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nThere are many people —               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– the same question.               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah. There are many people on Wall Street that say, “This is going to be the greatest windfall ever happen.”               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAnd that’s my question —               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nRemember this —               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– the long term.  \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nIs it okay in the short term to have a recession?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nRemember this. Look, yeah. Everything’s okay. What we are — I said, this is a transition period. I think we’re going to do fantastically. One of your colleagues on another fake news station, ABC, said, “Do you guarantee 100% that a certain person is going to do a fantastic job as, let’s say, Secretary of Defense?” Okay? Because that was the question. I said, “What kind of a question is that? Do I guarantee 100%? Nobody guarantees 100%.” But I will say this. I think we’re going to have an economy the likes of which we’ve never had before. You know, my four years were phenomenal, as you know. The stock market. In fact, even though we had to go through the Covid thing, that horrible situation with Covid, we did numbers — and when I gave it over, when I handed it over, the election was rigged, and I handed it — and because of that, we have a lot of problems, by the way. But when I handed it over, what happened? The market was higher than it was previous to just previous to Covid coming in. Nobody could believe it. The stock market, I’m talking about.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nI don’t want to look back, but you did take your case to court about that.               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo, you got to look back.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYou took your case to court about your allegations against the election. Let me ask you, sir —               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nAh, no no no. There’s no question about it. The election was rigged. The facts are in. And it’s still being litigated. Let’s go.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYou did take your case to court more than 60 times —               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo, no, sure.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– and didn’t win those cases.               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nSure. And I won a lot of court cases —               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nJust to button that up though, sir, just to button that up —               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWhat are you talking about? The election of —               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nHow worried are you —               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nAre we talking about the election of 2020?               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nNo, let’s talk about the here and now. Let’s talk about here and now —               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nThe election of 2020?               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nLet’s not talk about — let’s talk about here and now. Are you worried about a recession?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nOkay.               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo. No. I think we’re going to have the greatest economic —               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nI mean, are you worried it could happen? Do you think it could happen?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nAnything can happen. But I think we’re going to have the greatest economy in the history of our country. I think we’re going to have the greatest economic boom in history.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nLet me ask you about this call to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos this week in response to a report that Amazon was going to display tariff costs next to product prices. Are you going to punish CEOs who increase their prices because of tariffs?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI think what’s — what is a great misnomer is the word “tariff” in many cases, it’s not — to me, I don’t view it as a tax. I view it as an incentive for people to come into the United States and build plants, factories, offices, a lot of things. I think it’s an incentive. But the thing that’s not known is, if you look back and see, oftentimes, like China or Vietnam or other countries, not just China, because China’s an abuser, but there are other abusers. Many of them are friends, the so-called — I say friend and foe, and friend is oftentimes worse than foe. But what people don’t understand is, and this is a lot, the country eats the tariff. The company eats the tariff. And it’s not passed along at all.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWell, some CEOs —               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI don’t view it as a tax.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– are saying they’re going to have to pass it on. So how do you deal with those CEOs?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nIt may. It may. But the company —               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nHow do you deal with those CEOs?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nChina is eating the tariffs right now.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWhat do you say to those CEOs who are saying, “We might have to pass this on to the consumer?”               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, they say that because maybe it’s to their advantage to say it. Maybe they don’t —               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWill you punish them?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo, because you know what? I want them to build plants in the United States. That way, they don’t have any tariffs. See, tariffs will — and not only will, look at what’s happened. In two months, we’re close to $9 trillion of investment. We’ve never been anywhere near that.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWhat did you say to Jeff Bezos?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nHe’s just a very nice guy. We have a relationship. I asked him about it. He said, “Well, I don’t want to do that,” and he took it off immediately.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nSo he changed course. And will you take that same tactic with other CEOs if you feel like —               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nSure. I’ll always call people if I disagree with them.  \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYou’ll — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nIf I think that somebody’s doing something that’s incorrect, wrong, or maybe hurtful to the country, I’ll call. Absolu — wouldn’t you want me to call? Biden wouldn’t call because he didn’t know what was happening, but I do. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nTakes me to my next question. Today’s strong jobs report likely means — not clear, but likely means — the Fed is less likely to lower interest rates soon. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, he should lower them. And at some point, he will. He’d rather not because he’s not a fan of mine. You know, he just doesn’t like me because I think he’s a total stiff. And, you know, it’s just one of those things. He should lower them. And I wish the people that are on that board would get him to lower because we are at a perfect time. It’s already late. But he should lower interest rates. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nDo you rule out removing Fed Chair Jerome Powell? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI’m not — you know, I get to change him very quickly anyway. You know, it’s in a very short period of time.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nIn 2026. You’re not going to remove — you don’t have plans to remove him before 2026 when his time’s up?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo, no, no. That was a total — why would I do that? I get to replace the person in another short period of time.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nOkay. This week, you reshuffled your national security team.  \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYou moved National Security Advisor Mike Waltz to U.N. ambassador. Just to remind our viewers, Waltz, of course, started that unsecure text chain where sensitive information was shared. Mr. President, was that move a punishment?\\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo. I just think he’ll do a nice job in the new position. Marco’s doing an outstanding job. Now, Marco won’t keep — Marco’s very busy doing other things, so he’s not going to keep it long term. We’re going to put somebody else in. But I think Mike was a — as you know, he’s a fine guy. And I think he’ll do a very good job — knows the countries, knows leadership. And I think he’ll do a very good at the United Nations. And in the meantime, Marco’s really doing something special. And it’s going to work out very well.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWe’re hearing some potential names. Stephen Miller’s name, one of your long-time, most loyal aides. His name has been talked about as a potential national security advisor. Is he someone you’re looking at?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, I’d love to have Stephen there, but that would be a downgrade. Stephen is very — Stephen is much higher on the totem pole than that, in my opinion.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nCan you tell us who the front-runner is right now?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, I have a lot of people that want it. I will tell you, I have everybody calling. Everybody wants to be a part of this administration. So at some point we’ll — you know, probably do that. You know, there’s a theory. Henry Kissinger did both. There’s a theory that you don’t need two people. But I think I have some really great people that could do a good job.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nSo Secretary Rubio could continue to have both jobs indefinitely?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nHe could, yeah. He could. But I think he even would like to probably see — because it is a little bit different. But in the meantime, he’ll handle it. And I think Mike, if that goes forward, you know, he still has to get approved. But I think Mike will do a very good job at the United Nations.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth obviously also on that unsecure text chain. He was sharing sensitive information. Are you looking for a new secretary of defense, Mr. President?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo. Not even a little bit. No. Pete’s going to be great. We’re —                \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nHis job is safe right now?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWe’re doing a fantastic job against the Houthis, who like blowing ships up and watching them sink in the ocean. We’re hitting them very hard. No, he’s doing a very good job.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nHis job is safe right now?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nTotally safe.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nOkay. Let’s talk about the border.. Let’s talk about deportations. Border crossings are at their lowest level ever recorded. Is the border —               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nIs that good?               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nIs the border now secure?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah, it’s really secure.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nIt’s absolutely secure?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nIsn’t that good, though? When you say that, doesn’t that just sound good? After being abused for years by an incompetent president that allowed people to pour through an open border, criminals from all over the world, murderers and insane people from mental institutions and insane asylums, isn’t it — isn’t it a beautiful thing when you say, “It’s the most secure it’s ever been in the history of our country.” Isn’t that a nice statement? \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWell, I’m curious to know what it means. You declared a national emergency on the southern border.  \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nThe order is still in place. Even though —                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nBy the way, it means exactly what you said, you know —                                  \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– you’re saying the border is secure. Yes.                                  \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nMeans we have the most secure border we’ve ever had.                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWell, and I guess the question becomes —                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nIt’s not complicated.                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– when will you know that the emergency is over? Are you planning to lift it at some point? Is it necessary? Because obviously, the military’s involved. Will you lift that — that emergency order, sir?                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, the biggest emergency is the courts aren’t allowing us to take really —                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWe’re going to talk about that, but talk to me first about this —                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, that’s to me the emergency because —                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nTalk to me first about this, the emergency —                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nThe border now is not the emergency. The border is — it’s all part of the same thing though. The big emergency right now is that we have thousands of people that we want to take out, and we have some judges that want everybody to go to court —                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nSome of them you appointed, sir, including three on the Supreme Court.                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nThat’s all right. I mean, they change. I mean, it’s unbelievable. It’s unbelievable how that happens, but they do change.                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nJust to button this up, though, are you planning to lift that emergency order any time soon now that the border’s secure? You say the border’s secure.                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo, no, no. We have an emergency. We have a massive emergency overall. It’s an overall emergency on immigration. And the — if the courts don’t allow us to take people out, if we had to have a court case every single — think of it. Every single person, we have millions of people. If you have millions of court cases, figure two weeks a court case, it would be 300 years.                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nSo let’s talk about this, because obviously, you’ve had a back and forth with the Supreme Court. In a 9-0 decision, the Supreme Court directed your administration to facilitate the return, you’ve talked about this in the past, of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, from a prison in El Salvador, whose deportation your administration called an “administrative error.” You said in a recent interview you could bring him back but you won’t. Are you defying the Supreme Court, sir?                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo. I’m relying on the attorney general of the United States, Pam Bondi, who’s very capable, doing a great job. Because I’m not involved in the legality or the illegality. I have lawyers to do that and that’s why I have a great DOJ. We have a great one. We had a very corrupt one before. Now we have a great one. And they’re not viewing the decision the way you said it. They don’t view it that way at all. They think it’s a totally different decision.                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWell, you say you have the power to bring him back, though. Your attorney general says, quote, “That’s up to El Salvador.” Just to put a fine point on this, do you have the power to bring Abrego Garcia back as the Supreme Court has ordered?                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, I have the power to ask for him to come back if I’m instructed by the attorney general that it’s legal to do so. But the decision as to whether or not he should come back will be the head of El Salvador. He’s a very capable man.                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWell, you know, and your attorney general has said the issue is with that word “facilitate.” Will you seek clarification from the Supreme Court? Do you need to go back to the Supreme Court?                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWe may do that. I was asking about that. We may do that. There are some people that say, “Bring him back, put him in trial, and you get him out right away.” Because you take — you see what happened just this morning, tapes came out, horrible tapes from his wife. You don’t get much worse than that. You don’t get, I mean, he seems certainly like a very dangerous, very bad person. But even the wife who was so afraid, she was afraid to talk, and all of a sudden tapes got released this morning that were devastating to him.                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAnd this is the point, sir, about due process. The Constitution says every person, citizens and non-citizens, deserve due process. Why not push to have him come back, present all of that evidence in court, let a judge decide?                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, I’ll leave that to the lawyers, and I’ll leave that to the attorney general of the United States, because —                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nBut do you agree —                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n– they’re in it. You have to understand. I’m dealing with Russia and Ukraine. I’m dealing with China —                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAnd we’re going to talk about that.                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI’m dealing with Iran. I’m dealing with Rwanda and the Congo who are fighting and we’re trying to get that one straightened out. And I think we have done that, did a great job. Nobody even talks about it, but I think we’re close to doing that. They’re looking like they’re going to maybe make a peace deal, which was — would be good. But I’m dealing with a lot of different things. I don’t know much about this gentleman other than I hear he’s an absolute not good person. And I have very capable legal people, John Sauer, as you know, and all top people. And I have to rely on that to interpret whatever is said by the Supreme Court. Now with that being said, I have tremendous respect for the Supreme Court. Look, three of the people are people I appointed.                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nRight.                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nAnd I have great respect for the Supreme Court. And I would expect that the attorney general will be doing the right thing.                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYour secretary of state says everyone who’s here, citizens and non-citizens, deserve due process. Do you agree, Mr. President?                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI don’t know. I’m not, I’m not a lawyer. I don’t know.                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWell, the Fifth Amendment says as much.                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI don’t know. It seems — it might say that, but if you’re talking about that, then we’d have to have a million or 2 million or 3 million trials. We have thousands of people that are some murderers and some drug dealers and some of the worst people on Earth.                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nBut is —                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nSome of the worst, most dangerous people on Earth. And I was elected to get them the hell out of here and the courts are holding me from doing it.                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nBut even given those numbers that you’re talking about, don’t you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States as president?                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI don’t know. I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said. What you said is not what I heard the Supreme Court said. They have a different interpretation.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nIs anyone in your administration right now in contact with El Salvador about returning Abrego Garcia to the United States? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI don’t know. You’d have to ask the attorney general that question. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nOkay. At least two Americans have been mistakenly detained and released by your administration, immigration authorities. Mr. President, should lawful residents of this country start carrying paperwork with them when they leave their homes to be able to prove that they’re — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI don’t think that’ll be necessary, but what you’re not saying is that many people have been killed, maimed, badly hurt by illegal immigrants that came over that are from prisons and from jails and from mental institutions. And they’re hurting our people. And if we don’t get them out, we’re not going to have a country for long. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nThere — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWe need honest media, and we need walls. We need to have borders. And, by the way, I built a lot of walls, and if we didn’t do that, we wouldn’t be able to have those — you know, we would not be able to have the kind of numbers if I wasn’t successful in building hundreds of miles of wall. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nVery quickly, sir. The last time you and I spoke in December, you said that you would consider working on getting Dreamers legal status. Dreamers, of course, those who are brought here illegally as children. Where do those efforts stand — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nMany, many years ago — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nIs that a priority for you? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, it’s not a priority for the Democrats because every time we talk about it, they don’t want to talk about it because I guess they like it as a political issue. But they’re not good at political issues because they still want to have men play in women’s sports. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWell, Republicans do control Congress right now, Mr. President. Are you going to make — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah, but the Democrats don’t — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– Dreamers a priority? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, for that, you would need to have support from Democrats, and we have no support from the Democrats. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nHave you had any discussions about Dreamers? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah, we’ve had discussions. We would do something. I’d love to put a beautiful immigration for everybody. But the Democrats don’t want to approve anything. All they want to do is knock out a tax bill. We’re trying to get approved right now the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, and if it doesn’t get approved, it’s a 68% tax increase, and that’s what the Democrats want. They want a 68% tax increase. It’s rather incredible. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAnd I do want to talk to you about your legislation, but let’s talk about DOGE very quickly. DOGE has fired and then rehired thousands of federal workers, including FAA employees in charge of aviation safety, specialists working on nuclear weapon safety. What do you say to those who believe Elon Musk’s chain saw approach has jeopardized the safety and security of Americans? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, he found $160 billion worth of fraud, waste and abuse. I mean, I think he’s done an amazing job. I think his people have done an incredible job. They’re brilliant people. They know the computer. I actually asked him, “What’s their big trait?” He said, “They’re unbelievable at computers.” In other words, you can’t fake them out. Because these people were in many cases crooks, but it was fraud, waste and abuse. They found — your question should be asked a different way. “Were certain things found?” Yes. “How much?” $160 billion. Think of what $160 billion is. If you found 160 — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nHe said he’d find $2 trillion. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, we’re not finished yet. We’re not finished yet. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nDo you think the work continues even though he’s leaving? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nOh yes, of course, sure. He’s leaving behind some very brilliant people. They were on television last night. They’re super high IQ people. I like high IQ people. The Democrats don’t have many of them. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nLet me ask you about some news that broke. You are threatening to rescind Harvard’s tax-exempt status. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAnd yet, directing the IRS to investigate and rescind a university’s tax-exempt status is contrary to what’s in the federal law. The law says you can’t do this. Do you think you’re following the law? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, I tell you, I’m going to just follow what the lawyers say. They say that we’re allowed to do that, and I’m all for it. But everything I say is subject to the laws being 100% adhered to. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAre you willing to take this to court if it becomes a court fight? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nSure, why not? \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYou’re going to take it that far?  \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWe’ve won a lot of cases. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAll right, let’s talk about some of the other actions you’ve taken over the past 100 days. Last month, you directed your attorney general, Pam Bondi, to review two people who you perceive to be your political adversaries. And yet, you told me in December that you would not direct the Justice Department to investigate your political foes. What changed? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, no. I just look at people — and I’m not directing anybody. They looked at these two people. They might have known it or they might have heard it from two years ago. One person said, “He knew me so well,” he was I think on CNN or MSDNC, but they’re both failing networks, you’re happy to know. Even though one of them I guess is related to you in one form or another, although, they’re trying to cut them loose as fast as possible. But the — it was well-known that this one person, it was almost like he was my brother. I don’t even know who he is. Maybe he was there. Maybe he was in the Oval Office a few times as a surrogate for somebody in some form of government, along with 25 other people that sat in the back of the room or stood in the back of the room. I have no idea who this guy is. And he’s out there and then he did a book called “Anonymous.” Did a book called “Anonymous.” I think that’s really subversion. I think it’s spying, it’s something. It’s something really bad. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWell, you passed an executive order calling for your attorney general to investigate that. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nAnd I think he’s been looked at for a long time. And the other one said that the election was so wonderful. Well, it turned out it wasn’t a wonderful election. It was a corrupt election. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nLet me ask it this way, sir, because when we talked in December, I asked you, what is your message to people who didn’t vote for you? Let me remind you of what you said. You said, “I love you, and we’re going to all work together.” How does pursuing your political foes help to unify the country? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nDid I really say, “I love you?” \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYou really did. That’s a direct quote. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI’m sure you’re right, but I’d like to see that. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nI promise I’ll show it to you. I’ll show you the tape. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nLook — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nHow does that help to unify the country? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI want to treat people fairly, whether they voted for me or not. I want to have a unified country. It’s very hard because the media’s so fake, including, like, even the way you ask questions. Every question is asked in a negative vein. “There’s a toy company that took a toddler’s you know whatever.” But you don’t talk about the fact that gasoline is down at numbers that nobody believes possible. You know why they’re down, by the way? Drill baby, drill. We’re drilling like crazy right now. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWe try to make sure every question is fair, Mr. President. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, look. Every question you ask says a very negative slant. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nNo, no, no. But I’m just curious, are you — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nAnd I’m fine for responding to you. I don’t think you’re very difficult at all to respond to, to be honest with you. But you know what? You should ask some positive things, like, “Sir, it’s amazing what you’ve done with gasoline.” Because you know what? Gasoline’s big business. A stroller is not big business. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nBut to this question, Mr. President, you said you wanted to unify the country. Does going after political foes undercut that goal? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo, not at all. No, we want honest people. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nOkay. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI think you have to do that. And we want honest people in this country. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nLet me ask you big picture. People who have lived in countries like the Philippines, Hungary, Russia, they look at some of your actions — going after civil service, going after universities, law firms, the media — they say it’s out of an authoritarian playbook. What do you say to those who believe you are taking the country down an authoritarian path? \\nRecommended\\n  \\n\\nnews\\nTrump reverses brief reprieve for immigrants he said are 'good, long time workers'\\n  \\n\\npolitics\\nTrump administration live updates: Pete Hegseth questioned on Iran; Supreme Court upholds transgender care ban\\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, there you go again. Why don’t you ask it a different way? Many people want to come into our country. Many people love Trump. I won the election. They didn’t win the election. I got a lot more votes than they did. I won the popular vote. I won all seven swing states by a lot. A lot of people were surprised. They said, “I think he could win four, maybe five.” No, I won all seven, and I won by a lot. And I won. Actually, I think there was a lot of hanky panky going on but it was too big to rig. That’s the good news. It’s too big to rig. But let me just say, so when you make these statements about, “People say this –,” well, they had their chance at the election and they lost big. So you should ask the question differently —  \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWhat do you say to —  \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYou should say, “What about the people that want to be in this country? What about the people that love this country?” \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nOkay. But what do you say to — I’m asking it on behalf of those people to give you a chance to respond to them. What do you say to those people, sir? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nThose people are going to be very happy. They’re going to have to see some results. And I think we had a great 100 days. There are a lot of people that say it was unprecedented. It was an absolutely unprecedented 100 days. And I hope that they’re going to be right. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nDo you see dissent as an essential part of democracy? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nIt’s a part of democracy. It is. You’re always going to have dissent — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nIs it an important part of democracy? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYou’re always going to have — Kristen, you’re always going to have dissent. There’s nothing you’re going to do about that. Am I going to get 100% unified? It would be a strange place. I can’t even imagine it where 100%. Look. You have people that are good people. They’re very smart people. And they honestly believe we should have open borders and the entire world should be allowed to pour into our country. I think it’s a 95/5 issue, but they believe it. They’re not even bad people. Some of them are bad. You have people that honestly believe that men should be allowed to play in women’s sports. Some of these people I really, actually I don’t know any. I haven’t been able to find any, but they exist. They say it’s an 80/20 issue. I don’t believe that. I think it’s a 97 to three issue. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nDo you think people should have the right to criticize you without fear of reprisal? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nAbsolutely. Yeah, I do. That I do. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAnd how do you square that — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nAnd I think that happens. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nHow do you square that with the fact that you have passed these executive orders asking the attorney general to look into some of the people who’ve criticized you, who’ve been harshest against you? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI have been investigated more than any person in the history of the United States of America. I’ve been investigated more than the late great, as they say at my rallies, Alphonse Capone. Alphonse Capone was a nasty man. He was a — the highest level gangster. And I have been investigated more than Al Capone, more than anybody. These people are evil people. And I won. And I’ll tell you what. All I want to happen is for the Department of Justice and the FBI. Pam is great and Kash is great. I think they’re two great people. But they’re their own people. They want to do a fantastic job. And all I want to do and all I want to ask for is that they be allowed to do their job. I’m not telling them to do anything. And I believe I have the right to do it. I’m, in theory, the top law enforcement officer as the president. We went over this once before, and it turned out I was right. But I’m not looking to use that. We have two great people, and we have many, many incredible people under them. And I just want them to do their job and do it well. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nLet me ask you about something I don’t think you’ve been asked much about, which is you’ve branded your own cryptocurrency. The coin’s value actually surged recently after you announced that top holders would be invited to have dinner — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI don’t even know that. What did it surge to — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n — that people wanted to — what did it surge to? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah. What’s it worth? You might as well tell me, because I have no idea. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWell, it surged, I will find it, hold on one second, 5.2 or 58%, so 58%. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nTo what number? \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nThat’s not bad, 14.32. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWhat, billion? \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nFor — no, dollars per cryptocurrency. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nBillion dollars? \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nNo. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWhat’s the number? I mean, what is the amount? \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nThe meme coin’s value hit a peak of 75.35 on January 19. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, that doesn’t mean anything. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAnd that’s before your inauguration, and then it surged. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nLook. I’m in favor of crypto. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nOkay. But let me just ask you — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYou know what I’m in favor of it — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– what do you say to those who argue that when they hear that, they worry you’re profiting from the presidency? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI’m not profiting from anything. All I’m doing is, I started this long before the election. I want crypto. I think crypto’s important because if we don’t do it, China’s going to. And it’s new, it’s very popular, it’s very hot. If you look at the market, when the market went down, that stayed much stronger than other aspects of the market. But I want crypto because a lot of people, you know millions of people want it. I don’t know if you know that Biden went after it violently, and then before the election, he changed his tune entirely. His head of the SEC, everybody changed their tune. You know why? Because there were hundreds of millions of people that are participating in crypto, and they wanted to get their votes. But it didn’t work– \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nSo you’re not profiting off of the cryptocurrency at all? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI haven’t even looked. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nHas your family? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nBut I’ll tell you what. Look, if I own stock in something and I do a good job, and the stock market goes up, I guess I’m profiting. But who really profits is somebody like Nancy Pelosi, who uses inside information. She worked for $175,000 a year, and that’s at the high end. And she’s worth $150, $200 million? Okay? You ought to look at Nancy Pelosi and you ought to look at some of these politicians that are stone cold crooks. I was very wealthy when I came in. Being president probably cost me money if you really look. In fact, I do something that no other president has done, they think maybe George Washington has done. I contribute my entire salary to the government, back to the government. And I’m doing it again. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nSo will you contribute anything you earn from crypto back to the government if that happens? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI never thought of that. I mean, should I contribute all of my real estate that I’ve owned for many years if it goes up a little bit because I’m president and doing a good job? I don’t think so. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nOkay. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nBut I’ve done something that surprisingly they say nobody else has done, no other president has done. I give, and it’s a substantial salary. It’s a half a million dollars a year or $550,000 a year, four years, couple of million dollars. I gave it to the government last time. I never got a story saying I gave it. Nobody cared if I gave it. I guarantee if I didn’t give it, there’d be a big story. But no other president, they say with the possible exception of George Washington, and they haven’t been able to find those records. And we’ve had wealthy presidents before, but no other president has contributed his salary. And they told me before this that you will probably be asking me whether or not I’m going to contribute my salary again. But you haven’t asked that. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAre you going to? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYes. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYou are? Okay. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYes. I am. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nOkay. Well, I appreciate — we just made news there. Let’s talk about foreign policy, sir. You just signed a minerals deal with Ukraine. It’s a sign, it seems, that the United States is invested in Ukraine’s future. The secretary of state told me this is a very critical week. Are you any closer to reaching a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI hope so. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nHow would you characterize it?  \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI do believe we’re closer with one party, and maybe not as close with the other. But we’ll have to see. I’d like to not say which one we’re closer to. But we did do a deal for the American people that was good. We were able to get rare earth, you know? The Europeans are getting paid back. They have a loan. We didn’t — Biden just gave them $350 billion. He has no idea where the money is, what happened. And at least we’ll, in one form or another, get our — yeah, I don’t feel so foolish. And remember this, this is Biden’s war. This was a war that was never going to happen if I were president. This is a horrible, horrible war. And I get to see shots of soldiers through, you know, satellite that are so, just so, terrible. 5,000 soldiers are being, look 5,000 soldiers a week on average are dying. They’re not American soldiers. But I want to solve the problem. They’re Russian soldiers, and they’re Ukrainian soldiers. And if I can save 5,000 souls, I just love doing it. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nHow long do you give both countries before you’re going to walk away? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, there will be a time when I will say, “Okay, keep going. Keep being stupid and keep fighting.” \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWhen does that come? Are you close to it? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nSometimes I get close to it, and then positive things happen, okay? So I hope it gets done. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYour close ally, Senator Lindsey Graham, has a sanctions bill against Russia. If you get to that point, Mr. President, where you’re prepared to walk away, will you support — will you sign that sanctions bill? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, it depends on whether or not Russia is behaving toward coming to a peace. We want a peace deal. We want Russia and Ukraine to agree to a deal. We think we’re fairly close, and we’re going to save a lot of people from being killed. Going to save a lot of money, too. Because we’re spending money like — you know, Europe is spending a third of the money that we’re spending. And it’s more important for Europe than it is for us. Biden had no control. He just sent money over there willy-nilly, nobody had any idea what was happening, why they were doing it, why they were sending it. And it was massive amounts of money. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nSo you think you’re close to a deal? What will Russia have to give up? Because Ukraine, there’s been discussions they will have to give up some of the land that Russia’s illegally claimed. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nRussia will have to give up all of Ukraine. Because that’s what they want. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAll of Ukraine? Meaning they wouldn’t keep any of the land that they have claimed? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo, no. Russia would have to give up all of Ukraine. Because what Russia wants is all of Ukraine. And if I didn’t get involved, they would be fighting right now for all of Ukraine. Russia doesn’t want the strip that they have now; Russia wants all of Ukraine. And if it weren’t me, they would keep going. Do you know that the European Union leaders have asked me to call Putin so many times? Because he doesn’t return their phone call. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYou, you, posted on social media he might be “tapping” you along. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nMight be. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nDid you misread him– \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nBut you might be tapping me along, too, when you tell me how nice an interview this is going to be. So you know, I’m used to being tapped along. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nDid you in any way misread Vladimir Putin? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nDid I what? \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nMisread him? Now that you’re saying that. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo, I’ll tell you about in a month from now, or two weeks from now. I have no idea. I can tell you this, he’s — his ambition was stopped to a large extent when he saw that it was me that was now leading the charge. Because he wasn’t dealing with anybody in Europe, he wasn’t calling them back. Do you know that I asked him, I said, “Did Biden ever call you in three years? Did Biden ever call?” He said, “He never called.” You know, Biden didn’t call him one time? And all these thousands of soldiers, hundreds, millions of soldiers are dying, and people, not only soldiers. People dying in the cities, and the towns, and the whole heritage of that country is being blown apart. I mean, the country’s heritage is being blown apart. You know the steeples, those beautiful spires that you see, you know the most beautiful in the world? Almost 95% of them are laying in smithereens, all broken up and, so sad, laying all over the ground because they were shot. It’s really a bad situation. And he didn’t get one phone call from Biden. The war would’ve never started. And by the way, for four years it didn’t start. I was there for four years, it was the apple of his eye. This was the apple of Putin’s eye. There was no chance he would have gone in. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWhat’s the red line for you? At what point do you say, “That’s it, we’re walking away?” \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, you’ll know. I mean, there will be a time when I may say that. And if I do — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nBut you’re not there? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n– there may be something. I can’t — maybe it’s not possible to do. There’s tremendous hatred, just so you understand. Kristen, we’re talking tremendous hatred between these two men and between, you know, some of the soldiers, frankly. Between the generals. They’ve been fighting hard for three years. I think we have a very good chance of doing it. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nVery quickly, if you do walk away, would that mean that you would pull military and intelligence sharing? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI don’t want to say that now. It’s too early to say that. I don’t want to get into that argument. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nOkay, let’s move onto Canada. You have long talked about making Canada the 51st state. There’s obviously a new prime minister of Canada, Mark Carney, who you spoke to — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nCorrect. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– after his victory. He says that you didn’t talk to him in that call about making Canada a 51st state. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo. He called me, he was very nice, and I congratulated him. He had a victory. It’s a very close victory. You know, there’s no majority or anything, so that’s going to make things a little bit difficult, I think, for him to run. But he’d nevertheless had a victory. And he’s a very nice man, I think. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nDo you plan to talk to him about making Canada a 51st state? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nHe wants to come and see me. He’s going to come this week or next week. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nSo will you talk to him about making Canada a 51st state, annexing Canada? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI’ll always talk about that. You know why? We subsidize Canada to the tune of $200 billion a year. We don’t need their cars. In fact, we don’t want their cars. We don’t need their energy. We don’t even want their energy. We have more than they do. We don’t want their lumber. We have great lumber. All I have to do is free it up from the environmental lunatics. We don’t need anything that they have. We’re giving them — I asked, I asked Mr. Trudeau — who I call Governor Trudeau, not Prime Minister, Governor — I said, “Governor Trudeau, could I ask you one question? Why are we giving you $200 billion? Why are we subsidizing Canada?” If Canada was a state it wouldn’t cost us. It would be great. It would be such a great — it would be a cherished state. And, if you look at our map, if you look at the geography — I’m a real estate guy at heart. When I look down at that without that artificial line that was drawn with a ruler many years ago — was just an artificial line, goes straight across. You don’t even realize. What a beautiful country it would be. It would be great. But, I don’t think the American public wants me to pay $200 billion a year to subsidize Canada. Again, remember this, we don’t need their cars, we don’t need their lumber, we don’t need their energy. We don’t need anything. We do very little business with Canada. They do all of their business practically with us. They need us. We don’t need them. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYou and I talked, and I asked you if you would rule out military force to take Greenland. And you said, no, you don’t rule out anything. Would you rule out military force to take Canada? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, I think we’re not going to ever get to that point. It could happen. Something could happen with Greenland. I’ll be honest, we need that for national and international security. But I think — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nBut not with Canada? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n– it’s highly unlikely. I don’t see it with Canada. I just don’t see it, I have to be honest with you. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nOkay, but you don’t rule it out for Greenland? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nAnd by the way, Canada, they spend less money on military than practically any nation in the world. They pay NATO less than any nation. They think we are subsidizing, they think we are going to protect them, and really, we are. But the truth is, they don’t carry their full share, and it’s unfair to the United States and our taxpayers. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nBut you are not ruling out military force to take Greenland one day? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI don’t rule it out. I don’t say I’m going to do it, but I don’t rule out anything. No, not there. We need Greenland very badly. Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we’ll take care of, and we’ll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security. Do you know, we have Russian boats and we have Chinese boats, gun ships all over the place — aircraft carriers, gun ships — going up and down the coast of Greenland. We need that to be protected. Internationally we need it. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nSo you are willing to send U.S. troops to claim a sovereign territory? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI didn’t say that. You asked me a question, “Would you, is there a circumstance?” It could happen. I doubt it will, but it certainly could happen with respect to Greenland. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nOkay. Let me ask you about Iran. Your administration has had conversations with Iran. Is the goal of these talks limiting Iran’s nuclear program or total dismantlement? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nTotal dismantlement. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nThat’s all you’ll accept? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah, that’s all I’d accept. Now, there’s a new theory going out there that Iran would be allowed to have civilian — meaning to make electricity and to — but I say, you know, they have so much oil, what do they need it for? But you know, I’ve seen it with other states, where they’re looking to do something and they have a lot of oil. Iran has tremendous energy. You know I put sanctions, if you know that, I put pretty strong sanctions on two days ago, on the oil. The sad part is that if Biden didn’t get involved, if we had a competent president, you would’ve never had the attack on Israel. October 7th would’ve never taken place. Hamas would’ve had no money. Because Iran was broke. And now in a period of four years, during the Biden administration, they became very rich. They have over $300 million cash in the bank. And they had no money. They were ready to make a deal with me, and it’s very sad. Because of this rigged election they didn’t do it. Just another thing you can mark down to a bad election. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nIt’s interesting what you’re saying, though. Because Secretary Rubio has said that he would accept, or the idea is that there is an openness to accepting a peaceful, civil nuclear program. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell that’s what people — I didn’t say anything contradictory. I said that people are talking about that. And this is something that’s really pretty new in the dialogue. And I’d have to be, you know, my inclination is to say, “What do you need that for? You have a lot of oil.”                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nSo you want total dismantlement, bottom line?                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI think that I would be open to hearing it, you know? Civilian energy, it’s called. But you know, civilian energy often leads to military wars. And we don’t wanna have them have a nuclear weapon. It’s a very simple deal. I want Iran to be really successful, really great, really fantastic. The only thing they can’t have is a nuclear weapon. If they want to be successful, that’s okay. I want them to be so successful. And you know, the Iranian people are incredible. I just don’t want them to have a nuclear weapon because the world will be destroyed.                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nJust to recap, we’re talking about your desire to claim Canada, Greenland. What do you say to people —                                                \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYou forgot the Panama Canal.                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nPanama Canal. What do you say to people who say they voted for you because they wanted you to end foreign conflicts, not start new ones?                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI don’t see that as conflict. I think that’s good for our country, those things. Look, the Panama Canal was taken over by China, effectively. Now China seems to have left. But the Panama Canal — think of this deal. We built the most expensive object we’ve ever built in the history of our country. That was Mount McKinley, they just took away, I just gave it back the name. But, McKinley made the money, Teddy Roosevelt spent the money. McKinley takes gets very little credit, you know but you know how he made the money? Through tariffs. He was the big tariff president. Okay, but forget that. We built the Panama Canal. It was the most expensive thing. It would be the equivalent, like, almost $2 trillion today. We’ve never spent there — and it was very successful. And Jimmy Carter gave it away for $1. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nPanama insists they — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nThis is the kind of leadership —                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nPanama says they do control the canal. But we have a couple more questions left, and I’m getting a little wrap.                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nPanama said what? Panama said what?                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nPanama says they still control it. I know you’re saying China. Panama says they still control it.                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYou know, if you would have gone there about 5.2 months ago, every single sign on the Panama Canal, with the exception of about 15% of them, was in Chinese.                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYeah. Let me ask you, because we’re nearing the end, just a couple more questions here.                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI’m not complaining. You keep saying to me like I’m rushing —                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nNo, you’re not. And I really appreciate it.                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI don’t want to rush you. I don’t want to make you nervous.                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nThank you. The Trump organization is selling hats that say, “Trump 2028.”  \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP\\nYeah.  \\nKRISTEN WELKER: \\nAre you seriously considering a third term, Mr. President, even though it’s prohibited by the Constitution? Or is this about staying politically viable?                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI will say this. So many people want me to do it. I have never had requests so strong as that. But it’s something that, to the best of my knowledge, you’re not allowed to do. I don’t know if that’s constitutional that they’re not allowing you to do it or anything else. But, there are many people selling the 2028 hat. But this is not something I’m looking to do. I’m looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody, ideally a great Republican, a great Republican to carry it forward. But I think we’re going to have four years, and I think four years is plenty of time to do something really spectacular.  \\nKRISTEN WELKER: \\nThe Constitution does prohibit it. Have you — some of your allies are pretty serious about this, though, Mr. President. And I’ve spoken to them. They say they are coming up with potential ways, obviously the biggest one would be a constitutional amendment.  \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nThat’s because they like the job I’m doing, and it’s a compliment. It’s really a great compliment.                                               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nHas anyone approached you, though, with an actual plan, a way to actually start the process of a constitutional amendment?                                               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, there are ways of doing it. There are ways of doing it. And you know the same thing. And if you look at the vice presidential thing, and you hear different concepts and different other people say, “You can have a write-in vote.” There’s lots of different things. With all of that being said, I want to be a great president. I will have served — hopefully everything will go well. I feel very good. I just did a physical. I took — unlike all other presidents, I took cognitive tests and I aced it. I got 100% correct. And the doctor, one doctor said — there were numerous doctors watching. And he said, “I’ve never seen that before.” Biden didn’t take a cognitive — he couldn’t have gotten the first question right. But I came out great with the physical, both physically and mentally. And I just want to serve, do a great job. I’ll be an eight-year president, I’ll be a two-term president. I always thought that was very important, to be honest with you. You know, if you look at President Polk, he was a one-termer and he did some great things, actually. Pretty good president. And I’m not saying you can’t do that. But, there’s something about being a two-term president that was very important to me. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAnd just to put a button on it, has anyone in an official capacity presented you with, “Sir, here are some ideas by which you could actually get a constitutional amendment?” \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, in a capacity of being a big supporter, many people have said different things — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nOkay. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nBut, I’m not looking at that. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYou haven’t had official meetings about it? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo. And — and just so you understand, four years is a long time. I have almost four years. You know, all of these things that we’ve done, we’ve done more than any president — and even you might admit that. Nobody’s done the extent of — of the things that we’ve done. Nobody’s done this, in essentially a little bit more than three months. As they say, 100 days. I’m looking to do a great job as president, and set the country on the right track. Because if I didn’t win, this country would’ve failed. We would’ve been a failed nation. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYou have built a political movement that has transformed the Republican Party — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nGreatest in history. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nIt’s transformed the country — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nThe greatest — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– quite frankly. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n– political movement in history, MAGA. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWhen you — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nMake America Great Again. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWhen you look to the future, Mr. President, do you think the MAGA movement can survive without you as its leader? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYes, I do. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWhat gives you confidence? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI think it’s so strong. And I think we have tremendous people. I think we have a tremendous group of people. We talked about a number of them. You look at Marco, you look at JD Vance, who’s fantastic. You look at — I could name 10, 15, 20 people right now just sitting here. No, I think we have a tremendous party. And you know what I can’t name? I can’t name one Democrat. I mean, I look at the Democrats, they’re in total disarray. They have a new person named Crockett. I watched her speak the other day. She’s definitely a low IQ person. And they said she’s the future of the party. I said, “You have to be kidding.” I don’t know what they’re going to do. And I really believe in a two-party system. I really — because it’s good to be challenged. It’s really good to have a two-party — you know, it’s good. Being challenged is okay. It keeps you sharp. I don’t know what they’re going to do. They have nobody. Bernie’s 87 years old or something. And you know, Biden is the worst thing that ever happened to old people because he was grossly incompetent. And I think maybe for artificial reasons. You know, he had operations and things. So maybe that’s an artificial — but I know people that are unbelievably sharp and they’re older than 87. But I watch Bernie Sanders. He’s a nut job, but he’s still sharp. He’s sharp as — he’s the same guy he was. He hasn’t gone down. But Biden is really — he’s the worst thing to happen to old people.               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nI know that you are only 100 days in, but as we sit here today, who do you see as your successor, Mr. President?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, I — it’s far too early to say that. But you know, I do have a vice president, and typically — and JD’s doing a fantastic job. It —               \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nHe would be at the top of the list?               \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nIt — it could very well be — I — I don’t want to get involved in that. I think he’s a fantastic, brilliant guy. Marco is great. There’s a lot of them that are great. I — I also see tremendous unity. But certainly you would say that somebody’s the VP, if that person is outstanding, I guess that person would have an advantage. But I think the other people would all stay in unbelievably high positions. But you know, it could be that he’d be challenged by somebody. We have a lot of good people in this party. \\nSecond portion\\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nMr. President, thank you for having us here at Mar-a- \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, thank you. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n– Lago. What does Mar-a-Lago mean to you? It’s a special place. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nIt is a special — there’s no place like it. You look no matter where — it’s just — there’s nothing like it. And it’s become really the heart of Florida in a way but certainly the heart of Palm Beach, which is an important place. And I just don’t think there’s anything more beautiful in this country than Mar-a-Lago as, you know, as a physical object. It’s been amazing, and it’s been very successful and very special.\\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nIt’s the winter White House. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nIt is. It was built, you know by — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nOr it was built, essentially, for that reason. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n– E.F. Hutton and Marjorie Merriweather Post. They were married. He was the biggest man on Wall Street, and she was the richest woman in the world actually. And they built it together. And it just — they picked the best site. They picked the best architects. They had unlimited money, and they built it. Now it’s a — it’s a very special place. And Palm Beach likes me because I saved it. Most of these places were ripped down and 10 or 15 or 20 houses, mansions — beautiful mansions also but much smaller — they were built on those sites. And I was able to save this, which is very important. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWell, and I know that you were just in Michigan. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nRight. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYou were just talking to folks in Michigan to mark 100 days. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nRight. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nDo you anticipate doing more travel across the country? And what do you do to stay in touch with the workers who elected you, sir? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, I just went to a great place, University of Alabama, last night. This was some unbelievable evening. And I gave the commencement address, and it’s, like, different. Everybody was so awake, so lively, so — so attractive. And I’m not talking just physically attractive, just there was such an energy in the room. And it was really nice. You know, I won Alabama by many, many, many points. And they asked me to do it. And they put all of their — they had nine different, you know, business and law and this and that, all those different things. They put them all — journalism by the way — they put them all together, and we were in the big — that big arena. And it was tremendous energy. And — and that’s a little bit, you know, to your question, yeah, I think I get out quite a bit. I went to Michigan. I went — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYou think you’ll do more in these second 100 days? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI think I will. But we’re talking about the great, big, beautiful bill, you know, that we’re trying to get passed. It’ll be the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country, and hopefully it’ll get done. And the Democrats are fighting us. And if it doesn’t get done, it’s going to be a 68% tax increase. So that’s going to be the Democrats. But I think we’re going to have it done. I think the Republicans are going to vote for it. And it’ll be the most consequential bill I think in the history of our country. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nLeader Thune says he wants to get it done by July 4th. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nDo you think that’s possible? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI think it is, and I think he’s doing a fantastic job. And Mike Johnson, Speaker, is doing a fantastic job, and they’re both getting together well. There’s great unity in the Republican Party. The Republican Party’s a much different party than it was. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWhat happens if it comes to your desk, has the tax cuts, but also cuts to Medicaid? Would you veto that? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, we’re not doing that. No, we’re not — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWould you veto that? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI would if they were cutting it, but they’re not cutting it. They’re looking at fraud, waste and abuse. And nobody minds that. If illegal immigrants are in the mix, if people that aren’t supposed to be there, people that are non-citizens are in the mix, nobody minds that. Waste, fraud and abuse. But we’re not cutting Medicaid, we’re not cutting Medicare, and we’re not cutting Social Security. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYou also unveiled a budget. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nDeep cuts in some social services. What do you say to folks who may look at these cuts and say, “It’s going to impact education. It could impact people who rely on services for the poor?” \\nPRES DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, from what I understand — and first of all, the budget is a very preliminary instrument — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYes. \\nPRES DONALD TRUMP:\\n— and I think that when it’s all said and done you’re going to see a wonderful budget for everybody, really everybody. I would actually say the middle class probably goes to the fore, and it’s about time. But we took care of the middle class during my — during the original Trump tax cuts we really took care of the middle class. The people with the least amount of money actually were the biggest — and this isn’t just the middle class. The least amount of money, the poorest people, proportionately gained the most. And that’s what we’re looking to do here. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nSo you’re not concerned about it impacting education and other services? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNo. It depends what education. If you’re talking about Harvard, which has a — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nNo, no, I’m talking about education — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n— $53 billion in the bank because of a lot of things that they’ve been able to do and that the government help them with. That’s different. But, no, not education. We’re bringing education back to the states. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nLet me talk to you about TikTok — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYou know, that’s a big thing because education coming back to the states is a very big thing. We’re going to bring it back. The United States does not do well with education. We’re number 37, 38, 39 and 40 out of 40. And we’re going to bring it back to the states and we’re going to go to among the top ten I believe. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nLet me ask you about TikTok, sir. Would you extend that deadline if there’s still no deal? You already — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI would. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n— put one extension — you would? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah, I would. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nSo, you’re going to — you want to see a deal? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI’d like to see it done. I have a little sweet spot in my heart because, as you know, I won young people by 36 points. That’s a lot. No Republican ever won young people, and I won it by 36 points, and I focused on TikTok. So perhaps I shouldn’t say this, but I have a little warm spot in my heart for TikTok. TikTok is — it’s very interesting, but it’ll be protected. It’ll be very strongly protected. But if it needs an extension, I would be willing to give it an extension, might not need it. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nBut where are discussions? Is it close to a deal? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell we’re not — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nIs someone close to — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah. Yeah, we — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n— purchasing it? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n— actually have a deal. We have a group of purchasers, very substantial people. They’re going to pay a lot of money. It’s a good thing for us. It’s a good thing for China. It’s going to be, I think, very good. But because of the fact that I’ve essentially cut off China right now with the tariffs that are so high that they’re not going to be able to do much business with the United States. But if we make a deal with China I’m sure that’ll be a subject, and it’ll be a very easy subject to solve. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWe’re talking about your agenda, your budget bill, your tax bill, and you think about the next big test, which is the midterms. How do you see your role in the midterms? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI’m going to be very active. I’ve raised a lot of money for congressmen and senators that I think are good — really good people. We have some great Republican congressmen and women and senators that love this country, and they’re not lunatics like some of these Democrats. What they’re doing to the country is incredible. It’s insane. There’s something wrong with them. They suffer a major case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. I mean, it doesn’t — nothing matters to them other than that. Yeah, I’m going to be much involved. The interesting thing is — and nobody can explain why — but when somebody wins the presidency they seem to lose Congress. They seem to lose the House and the Senate or — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nHow concerned are you about that? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI don’t know why it would be. I think we should do better. But if you look it’s pretty consistent that whoever wins the presidency ends up losing the House, losing the Senate. I think we’re going to turn that around. I think we’re going to turn it around easy. It should be the opposite. If we do a good job, let’s say as president if I do a good job, it should be the opposite. So hopefully we’ll dispel that. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWell, it looks like you’re also looking at the history books. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nHow concerned are you about losing one or both chambers? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nIt’s a long way away. It’s a long way. You know, we’re in here for a little more than three months. We have a long way to go. I’ve raised a lot of money. We’re having a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago tonight for exactly that purpose. We want to win the House in bigger numbers. But, you know, we had a one majority three months ago. Now we have seven because we won a few races. I guess you know that. But we won a few races. But we’re up seven now, and we’re up — we have 53 senators. And I think we’re going to be in very good position. I expect to win by a bigger margin than we have now. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nIf you do lose one chamber, are there areas where you think you could find common ground with Democrats? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, there should be, but they seem to be stone cold. Look — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nIs there anything — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n— the one — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n— in your mind though? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n— thing I will say about the Democrats, they stick together. They have horrible policy. Men in women’s sports, transgender for everyone, open borders. The craziest policies I’ve ever seen. But regardless of how crazy they are, they stick together. And I respect that. I think it’s a great thing. And I think the Republicans are starting to do that also. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nSo looking forward, sir, one of the big features of your first administration was the first lady. She had her “Be Best” campaign.  \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nRight. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWill people start to see more of her? Will she come back — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n— with her “Be Best” campaign, for example? Can you give us a little — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nSure. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n— bit of a preview of what we can see? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, as an example, she did a book and she was number one bestseller for a long time, for many, many weeks. The people love her. She’s a very private person, which I respect a lot. She doesn’t have to be out. I know people where they have wives in politics and the wife wants to be in front of the husband all day long, waving to everybody. She’s got great confidence in herself and she doesn’t need that. But when she goes out. We were out, as you know, last weekend. It was an amazing, amazing day. The people love her. They really respect her, and they love her. Yeah, she’ll be very much involved. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAnd that’s part of why I’m asking you. I mean, can people expect to see her revive her “Be Best” campaign? Can you give — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, she is — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n— us a little preview? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, it’s still a campaign that’s very important to her, and it’s sort of a cute name, “Be Best.” I said, “That’s a strange name,” but it’s really beautiful and it sort of, you know, means something now that I didn’t understand, lot of people didn’t understand. And she’s done a great job. She’s raised a lot of money. She cares a lot about people, really cares a lot about people — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWhen you and I talked in December we talked about the fact that in this second administration your family is not there.  \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, that was — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAnd they were really some of your closest advisors — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nSure. Sure. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWhat is it like to be there and are they still, I would imagine, your closest advisors? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nThey’re with me all the way. But I think they were treated very unfairly. Ivanka worked so hard on getting jobs for people. You know, I wanted to make her the head of — the ambassador to the United Nations. There would be nobody that would be better than her. She said, “Dad, I don’t want to do that. I just want to get” — you know, she worked on getting people jobs. It sounds good in one way, but it doesn’t sound as exciting as other jobs. And she just wanted to do that. And she got hundreds of thousands of jobs for people. It made her so happy. She’s a good person. The way they went after Don and Eric, I said, “Just relax,” because I thought it was unfair. They went after these kids, and they’re really good. And they’re no longer kids, but they’re always going to be my kids.  \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYeah. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nThey were treated so unfairly. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nBarron’s in college now. How is he liking college? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nRight.  \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nHow’s he doing? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nHe’s a great student. He’s doing very well, goes to a great school. But he’s doing really well. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAnd is there any challenge being in college, having your dad as president of the United States? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, you’ll have to ask him someday that, but we try and make it as normal as possible. There’s nothing normal about it. But he’s a very great guy and wonderful kid. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYour birthday’s coming up. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAnd there are reports that you’re looking into the possibility of a military — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\n— parade. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nNot for my birthday. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWhen can you tell — when would it be? What can you tell me? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, my birthday happens to be on Flag Day. So — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWell, there you go — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n— I think they’re talking about Flag Day. But I view it for Flag Day, not necessarily my birthday. Somebody put it together. But no, I think we’re going to do something on June 14th maybe or somewhere around there. But I think June 14th, it’s a very important day. It’s Flag Day, plus we’re going to have different days. You know, if you look at Russia, they celebrate Victory Day.  \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYeah. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nIf you look at France, I was talking to Prime Minister Macron and he says, “Yes, there’s Victory Day, Victory Day.” And I say, “Victory Day for what?” “World War II.” I said, “Well, we had more to do with winning World War II than any other nation. Why don’t we have a Victory Day?” So we’re going to have a Victory Day for World War I and for World War II. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAnd will it be a military parade? What can people expect? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nAnd you have breaking news because nobody knows this. We’re going to have Victory Day for World War I and for World War II. Well, it’s going to start off by saying, “It’s Victory Day,” because, you know, when other nations, some of which weren’t even very successful in the war, they have Victory Days and the United States doesn’t. And we’re the one that won those wars with the help of others, with the help of others. But we’re going to have a Victory Day for I and II. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nBut one day, right? Both on one day? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nMaybe not because — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nOh, really? More than one day? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, they took place on very different days, you know. They’re about six months apart. So I think you can have two days. This doesn’t mean we’re going to go and not work and have a national holiday and all of that because we don’t have many of those days left. You know, eventually our country will become all national holidays. But we’re going to acknowledge by having days for World War I victory and World War II victory — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAnd just paint a picture for me. What will those parades look like? Will it be military parades? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYou mean, like, on Flag Day? \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYes. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWe’re going to have a big, beautiful parade. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nA military parade? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah, sure.\\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nOkay. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWe’re going to celebrate our military. We have the greatest military in the world — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWhat’s the price tag? Do you know? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nPeanuts compared to the value of doing it. We have the greatest missiles in the world. We have the greatest submarines in the world. We have the greatest army tanks in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world. And we’re going to celebrate it. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAnd, sir, finally, you’ve talked about the fact that you’re putting some of your own touches on the White House — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAnything that you can share about what you may be planning for the White House?  \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nSure. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWhat’s going to look different? I know you are thinking about making the Rose Garden look a little bit different. Anything you can share? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWell, the problem with the Rose Garden is the grass is always soaking wet and you can’t use it for news conferences. You’re supposed to have news conferences, meetings, all this in the Rose Garden. So we’re going to put a beautiful stone surface down so that people — for instance, we had something the other day and it actually didn’t rain for three or four days and the women were still getting stuck in the grass. And we want to put it to work. So we’re going to do something in terms of a hard surface. It’ll look beautiful, you know — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAnd where will it be specifically? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nWhere the grass is, where there’s — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWhere the grass is — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n— grass is. There’s grass in the middle. The roses stay. Everything stays just the way it was, including the limestone paths and everything else. But we had the prime minister of India here and they had a lot of press, and the women were walking out with their shoes full of mud. So we can’t have that. The other thing — and you see what I’ve done to the Oval Office and that continues, 24-carat gold. It’s beautiful. And we have really gotten — because I know that people can be fresh and nasty, you know, but we’ve been getting rave reviews. It was not taken care of the way it should. Now, I have an advantage. I was a really good real estate developer so I know how to get things done. I know how to build it. You’ll see it in a minute when you look at the ballroom, which I built at Mar-a-Lago.  \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nCould anything — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nBut the other thing, and the big thing, is going to be for 50 years they’ve wanted to build a ballroom at the White House. And they’ve tried, but the presidents were not real estate people. They had no clue. All you have to do is look at President Obama and look at his museum or library, whatever they call it, in Chicago. It’s a catastrophe. It’s way over-budget. Maybe it comes to an end. I don’t know what’s going on. But it’s a disaster because — and it’s not his fault. He’s not a real estate person. He doesn’t know how to build. I do really well. And what we’re going to do, you’re going to see the most beautiful ballroom in the world right now when you take a look. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nIs —  \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nBut we are going to make and build a ballroom, which they’ve wanted for probably a hundred years at the White House. And it’ll be a world-class, beautiful ballroom, and they’ll use the meeting rooms already existing. And we’re going to get that started over the next few months, and it’s going to be beautiful. And it’ll be done properly, and I will fund it. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWill you bring — you will fund it? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYeah. Yeah, I’m not going to ask the government for money. I’ll fund it, and I’m sure we’ll have some donations to it. But it’s not an inexpensive thing. It’ll cost a lot of money. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nWhere will it be? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nIt’ll be near the — I guess you would say the East Wing, near the East Wing, a little complicated to explain without a drawing. But we have three or four different concepts, and we’re working with great architects, with great planners. And it will be something really beautiful, top of the line.  \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nFinally, sir — \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nYou know, when they have a party for, like, when the head of China comes in — \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nYeah. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\n— or the head of anybody, you know, head of anything, they have a party where they have a tent 200 yards away, where people have to walk in the rain to get to a tent. And that’s not for us. That’s not for the United States of America. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nI know you — you’re only 100 days into this second term, but have you thought about what you want your legacy to be? \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nI want my legacy to be very much as the name of MAGA and what it represents. It’s called “Make America Great Again.” We were a great country for a period of time, and the last four years have been a disaster for the reputation of this country and for the fact of the country. It’s been a disaster. We’re going to make America great again. That’s all I want to do. I want to make it greater than ever before. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nThank you, Mr. President. \\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\\nThank you very much. \\nKRISTEN WELKER:\\nAppreciate it.\")]"
