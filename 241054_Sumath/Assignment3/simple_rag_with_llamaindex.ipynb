Chapter 3: Effects of Climate Change The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world and are projected to intensify in the coming decades. These effects include: Rising Temperatures Global temperatures have risen by about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 19th century. This warming is not uniform, with some regions experiencing more significant increases than others. Heatwaves Heatwaves are becoming more frequent and severe, posing risks to human health, agriculture, and infrastructure. Cities are particularly vulnerable due to the \"urban heat island\" effect.\n",

Cities are particularly vulnerable due to the \"urban heat island\" effect. Heatwaves can lead to heat-related illnesses and exacerbate existing health conditions. Changing Seasons Climate change is altering the timing and length of seasons, affecting ecosystems and human activities. For example, spring is arriving earlier, and winters are becoming shorter and milder in many regions. This shift disrupts plant and animal life cycles and agricultural practices. Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels Warmer temperatures are causing polar ice caps and glaciers to melt, contributing to rising sea levels. Sea levels have risen by about 20 centimeters (8 inches) in the past century, threatening coastal communities and ecosystems. Polar Ice Melt\n",
