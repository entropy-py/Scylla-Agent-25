        "This system is inspired by the research paper “Talk to the Right Specialists: Routing and Planning in Multi-agent Systems for Question Answering”, which addresses a key problem in enterprise-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems: scalability and efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "When companies like Tata or Apple deploy agentic assistants, they deal with large volumes of proprietary internal data such as finance, HR, legal policies, and engineering documents. Running similarity search over the entire knowledge base for every user query quickly becomes computationally expensive and slow.\n",
        "\n",
        "To solve this, the paper proposes an architecture where the knowledge base is subdivided into logical domains (such as HR, medical, finance, etc.). An LLM-based routing module first classifies the incoming query and dispatches it to the most relevant knowledge base. Once routed, the system performs retrieval and response generation on that specific domain, improving both response accuracy and system latency.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, I implemented a miniature version of this idea for IIT Kanpur. The knowledge base is divided into three domains: academics (which includes grading policies, course structure, and programs like double majors or minors), administration (which includes leaves, reimbursements, and medical insurance), and hostel/mess (which includes hall rules, mess policies, and related logistics).\n",
        "\n",
        "The query is first passed through an LLM-based router, which semantically classifies the query into one of these three domains. Based on the classification, a domain-specific RAG pipeline is triggered. Each domain has its own vector store (built using Cohere embeddings and ChromaDB) and prompt template, and uses a RetrievalQA chain to fetch relevant information and generate a response.\n",
        "\n",
        "This architecture is conceptually similar to the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) method, but here we use an LLM based classification instead of running similarity searches to narrow the context.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the idea is to avoid blindly searching across the entire context by semantically understanding the query and sending it to the right “specialist” - in this case, a domain-specific RAG pipeline. This structure-aware approach makes the system more efficient, more scalable, and more accurate than a vanilla RAG that operates over a single large vector index."
